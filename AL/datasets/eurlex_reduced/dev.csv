0,REGULATION (EEC) No 2481/75 OF THE COUNCIL  of 29 September 1975  amending Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 laying down special measures for improving the production and marketing of Community citrus fruits THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  and in particular Article 43 thereof; Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1); Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 (2) of 9 December 1969 laying down special measures for improving the production and marketing of Community citrus fruits  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 175/73 (3)  provides for the granting of additional aid to small farmers to compensate for part of the loss of income caused by replanting; Whereas one of the conditions for the granting of this aid is that the area of the undertaking does not exceed five hectares ; whereas  when the total area of the undertaking exceeds five hectares but the area fit for agricultural use does not exceed that limit since the rest of the land is not cultivable  the farmer's economic situation is the same as in the cases mentioned in the Regulation ; whereas all farmers of an area fit for agricultural use not exceeding five hectares should receive identical treatment; Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 set up in particular a scheme of financial compensation to promote sales of Community-produced oranges and mandarins on Community import markets by means of contracts ensuring regular supplies for these markets; Whereas experience has shown that the contractual scheme referred to above has not had the desired results as regards the growth of Community outlets for the products in question ; whereas  moreover  the increase in competition from certain producer third countries can only make it more difficult to market Community-produced citrus fruit on the Community market; Whereas to counter these difficulties Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 should be modified by discontinuing the contractual scheme and increasing the amounts of financial compensation ; whereas this compensation should be extended to include clementines; Whereas during the recent marketing years there have also been problems as regards the distribution of Community lemon production on the Community import markets ; whereas  therefore  it is advisable  as a precautionary measure  to grant financial compensation in respect of this product for the remainder of the 1975/76 marketing year; Whereas  in order to ensure the effectiveness of such a system  provision should be made for bringing up to date the amounts fixed in respect of oranges  mandarins and clementines  taking into account the trend of the basic and buying-in prices for the products concerned ,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

(2) On 22 October 2001  Denmark transferred to Sweden 50 tonnes of whiting in the waters of Skagerrak and Kattegat. Fishing for whiting in the waters of Skagerrak and Kattegat by vessels flying the flag of Sweden or registered in Sweden should consequently be authorised. Regulation (EC) No 743/2001 should therefore be repealed ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

3,23.12.2005 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 340/39 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2129/2005 of 22 December 2005 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1)  and in particular Article 13(3) thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2)  and in particular Article 14(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

5,Commission Decision of 28 December 1979 authorizing the Federal Republic of Germany to restrict the marketing of seed of certain varieties of agricultural plant species (Only the German text is authentic) (80/126/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species [1]  as last amended by Council Directive 79/967/EEC of 12 November 1979 [2]  and in particular Article 15 (2)  (3) and (7) thereof  Having regard to the application lodged by the Federal Republic of Germany  Whereas under Article 15 (1) of the said Directive  seed or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during 1977 in one or more Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in the said Directive are  with effect from 31 December 1979  no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety in the Community; Whereas  however  Article 15 (2) thereof provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties; Whereas the Federal Republic of Germany has applied for such authorization for a certain number of varieties of different species; Whereas the variety Kaweintermono (sugar beet) and the concerned varieties of oats and of maize have not been the subject of official growing trials in the Federal Republic of Germany in view of the German application; Whereas the said variety of sugar beet has been the subject in the Federal Republic of Germany of an application for official acceptance in so far as their seed is to be marketed in another country (Article 4 (2) (b) thereof); whereas therefore even the applicant has not claimed that this variety has any satisfactory value for cultivation or use in the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas therefore this variety can be treated as not producing results in the Federal Republic of Germany  which  with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use  correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (first subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) thereof); Whereas the variety of oats concerned is of the winter type; whereas the varieties of maize concerned have an FAO maturity class index over 350; whereas it is well known that the varieties of winter oats and the varieties of maize which have an FAO maturity class over 350 are at present not yet suitable for cultivation in view of all the kinds of utilization in the Federal Republic of Germany (second subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) of the said Directive); Whereas the other varieties listed in this Decision have been the subject of official growing trials in the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas the results of these trials have led the Federal Republic of Germany to decide that these varieties are not distinct or that their value for cultivation or use does not correspond to other varieties accepted in the Federal Republic of Germany; Whereas  in respect of the varieties Bergond (Red fescue) and Goal (Perennial rye grass)  the results of the trials show that in the Federal Republic of Germany  when compared with the national rules governing the acceptance of varieties there  which apply within the framework of current Community provisions  they are not distinct from other varieties accepted there (Article 15 (3) (a) thereof); Whereas therefore the application of the Federal Republic of Germany in respect of all these varieties should be granted in full; whereas some of the concerned varieties of maize are acceptable in the Federal Republic of Germany in so far as their seeds are intended for fodder production (green fodder); Whereas  in respect of the other cases the application of the Federal Republic of Germany is under examination by the Commission; whereas it is not possible to complete examination of the abovementioned variety before expiry of the period provided for in Article 15 (1) of the said Directive; Whereas it consequently seems desirable to extend for the Federal Republic of Germany the period in question for an appropriate time to permit a full examination of the request for those varieties (Article 15 (7) of the said Directive); Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seed and Propagating Material for Agriculture  Horticulture and Forestry ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 provides that if during the period of application  the average import duty calculated differs by EUR 5 per tonne from the duty fixed  a corresponding adjustment is to be made. Such a difference has arisen. It is therefore necessary to adjust the import duties fixed in Regulation (EC) No 649/2002 ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7,Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2003 of 14 November 2003 fixing the import duties in the cereals sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1104/2003(2)  Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 of 28 June 1996 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1110/2003(4)  and in particular Article 2(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff are to be charged on import of the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However  that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff. (2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market. (3) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector. (4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. They also remain in force in cases where no quotation is available for the reference exchange referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 during the two weeks preceding the next periodical fixing. (5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally  the representative market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties. (6) Application of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 results in import duties being fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8,2.3.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 64/20 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 223/2007 of 1 March 2007 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1)  and in particular Article 31(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

(2) However  the information presently available on the conditions applying in third countries is still not sufficient to enable the Commission to adopt any such decision in respect of any third country at this stage. (3) In order to prevent trade patterns from being disrupted  Member States importing vegetable propagating and planting material  other than seed  from third countries should be allowed to continue to apply to such products conditions equivalent to those applicable to similar Community products in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 92/33/EEC. (4) The period of application of the derogation provided for in Article 16(2) the first subparagraph of Directive 92/33/EEC  which was extended until 31 December 2004 by Commission Decision 2002/111/EC (2) should accordingly be further extended.

11,31.8.2012 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 234/4 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 784/2012 of 30 August 2012 amending Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 to list an auction platform to be appointed by Germany and correcting Article 59(7) thereof (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1)  and in particular Articles 3d(3) and 10(4) thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 of 12 November 2010 on the timing  administration and other aspects of auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community (2)  allows Member States not participating in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) to appoint their own auction platform for the auctioning of their share of the volume of allowances covered by Chapters II and III of Directive 2003/87/EC. The appointment of such auction platforms is subject to listing of the auction platform concerned in Annex III  pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 30(5) of that Regulation. (2) In accordance with Article 30(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010  Germany informed the Commission of its decision not to participate in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) of that Regulation  and to appoint its own auction platform. (3) On 9 March 2012  Germany notified the Commission of its intention to appoint European Energy Exchange AG (‘EEX’) as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. (4) On 22 March 2012  Germany presented the notification to the Climate Change Committee. In addition  Germany has provided further information and clarification to the Commission  supplementing the notification accordingly. (5) The proposed appointment of EEX as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 is compatible with the requirements of that Regulation and is in conformity with the objectives set out in Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC. (6) In accordance with point (e) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010  an auction platform must not abuse the contract appointing it to unduly leverage the competitiveness of its other activities  notably the secondary market it organises. Therefore  the listing of EEX as an auction platform should be conditional upon EEX providing the option to candidate bidders to be admitted to bid in the auctions without being required to become a member of or a participant in the secondary market organised by EEX or of any other trading place operated by EEX or by any third party. (7) In accordance with point (h) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010  when appointing an auction platform  the Member States have to take into account the extent to which adequate measures are provided to require an auction platform to hand over all tangible and intangible assets necessary for the conduct of the auctions by an auction platform’s successor. Such measures should be laid down in a clear and timely manner in an exit strategy that should be reviewed by the auction monitor. EEX should develop such an exit strategy and take into utmost account the auction monitor’s opinion thereon. (8) An auction platform is required to obtain the auction monitor’s opinion on the methodology for the application of Articles 7(6) and 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. However  where the auction monitor has not been appointed before the start of the auction concerned  the auction platform should be allowed to proceed without having obtained the auction monitor’s opinion. (9) Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly. (10) Moreover  certain references in Article 59(7) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 should be corrected. (11) In order to ensure predictable and timely auctions by the auction platform to be appointed by Germany  this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency.

PROCEDURE (1) On 10 September 1997  the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious dumping by imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China. (2) The complaint was lodged by the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic)  on behalf of Degussa AG  the sole producer of thiourea dioxide in the Community. (3) The complaint contained evidence of dumping by the imports concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (4) The Commission  after consultation  accordingly announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide currently classifiable within CN code ex 2930 90 70 originating in the People's Republic of China. (5) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producer. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) By a letter of 6 April 1998 to the Commission  Cefic formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China citing changed circumstances as regards the Community industry having occurred after the lodging of the complaint. In particular  the complainant submitted that the situation of the sole Community producer had changed in the course of the investigation  mitigating the effect of the allegedly dumped imports. (7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Council Regulation  (EC) No 384/96 when the complainant withdraws its complaint the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The Commission considered that the present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would be against the termination of the proceeding. (8) Interested parties were informed of the Commission's intention to terminate the proceeding and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest. (9) Therefore the Commission has concluded that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China should be terminated without the imposition of measures ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For the sake of simplification it is necessary to convert that amount into head for live bovines and into tonnes for other products. (2) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 lays down a period of validity of 75 days for export licences with advance fixing of the refund for pure-bred breeding animals falling within CN code 0102 10 and a period of four months plus the current month for licences issued under the procedure referred to in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88. Experience has shown that those periods are too brief and that they should be extended to five months plus the current month. At the same time  there should accordingly be a derogation increasing from 21 to 90 days the time limit referred to in Article 44(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 within which the exporter must inform the agency issuing the licence of the result of a tendering procedure opened in a third country.

For the sake of harmonisation  imports under the quotas of ‘baby beef’ originating in Croatia  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro should also be made subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the goods originate from the issuing country and that they correspond exactly to the definition in Annex III to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia or with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or Annex II to the Interim Agreement with Montenegro respectively. A model should also be established for the certificates of authenticity and detailed rules laid down for their use.

(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that  to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported  the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds. (3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (4) Pursuant to Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Shelled almonds  hazelnuts and walnuts in shell can currently be exported in economically significant quantities. (8) Compared with other fruit and vegetables  nuts are relatively easy to store. Export refunds can accordingly be fixed for longer periods with a view to rational management of the arrangements.

(10) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore  care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables  quotas should be fixed for each product. (11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2849/2000(6)  establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds. (12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(7) lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products. (13) Owing to the market situation  in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports  the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A 1 and A 2 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2190/96 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question. (14) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund  taking account in particular of their perishability.

(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999  provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14  15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund  in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods' importation into a third country.

(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination  quantities  qualities and presentations. (6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products""  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ""other cereals""  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) However  in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets  allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported. (6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999(3)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 164/2002(4)  the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire having a diameter 1 mm or more (hereinafter referred to as ""the product concerned"") falling within CN code ex 7223 00 19 originating in India. The measures took the form of ad valorem duties of between 0 % and 35 4 % on individual exporters  with a residual duty of 48 8 %. B. CURRENT PROCEDURE 1. Request for review (2) Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures  the Commission received a request for the initiation of an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999  pursuant to Article 20 of the basic Regulation  from one Indian producer  Garg Sales Co. PVT Ltd (the applicant). The applicant claimed that it was not related to any other exporters of the product concerned in India. Furthermore  it claimed that it had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998)  but had exported the product concerned to the Community after that period. On the basis of the above  it requested that an individual duty rate be established for it. 2. Initiation of an accelerated review (3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  the Commission initiated  by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities(5)  an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the company concerned and commenced its investigation. 3. Non cooperation by the exporting producer (4) In order to obtain the information it deemed necessary for its investigation  the Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant. However  the Commission did not receive any reply to the questionnaire within the deadline set for that purpose. Neither did the applicant request an extension of that deadline. The Commission informed the applicant that in these circumstances it was intended to proceed with the termination of the review investigation without examining further its request for establishing an individual duty rate. The applicant was given a period of 10 days to comment. No comments from the applicant were received on the disclosure of the Commission's intention to terminate the review investigation. (5) Consequently  it must be concluded that Garg Sales Co. PVT Ltd has failed to cooperate in the investigation by not replying to the questionnaire sent by the Commission. The accelerated review should therefore be terminated ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

87,"COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1683/1999 of 28 July 1999 initiating an investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 584/96 on imports of certain tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel originating in the People's Republic of China by imports of the same tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel transhipped through Taiwan  and making such imports subject to registration THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98(2) and in particular Articles 13(3) and 14(5) thereof  After having consulted the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. REQUEST (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Basic Regulation"") to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 584/96(3) on imports of certain tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel (hereinafter referred to as ""tube and pipe fittings"") originating in the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as ""the PRC""). According to the request  the aforementioned anti-dumping measures are allegedly circumvented by imports of the same tube and pipe fittings transhipped  without undergoing substantial transformation  through Taiwan. Furthermore  a request was made to make these imports subject to registration by the Customs authorities pursuant to Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation and  where justified  to propose to the Council the extension of the above anti-dumping measures to these imports. B. APPLICANT (2) The request has been lodged on 11 June 1999 by the Defence Committee of the EEC steel butt-welding fittings industry on behalf of producers representing approximately 90 % of the Community production of tube and pipe fittings. C. PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the allegation of circumvention is tube and pipe fittings (other than cast fittings  flanges and threaded fittings)  of iron or steel (not including stainless steel)  with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609 6 mm  of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes  currently classifiable within CN codes ex 7307 93 11  ex 7307 93 19  ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90. These codes are given for information only. D. EVIDENCE (4) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence in accordance with the requirements of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation  that the anti-dumping measures on imports of tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel originating in the PRC are being circumvented by imports of the same tube and pipe fittings transhipped through Taiwan. (5) The evidence submitted is as follows: (a) The request shows that a clear change in the pattern of trade between the PRC  Taiwan and the Community has taken place  following imposition of provisional measures in 1995 and definitive measures in 1996. Volumes of imports originating in the PRC  recorded under CN codes within which the tube and pipe fitting are classified  have decreased from 3941 tonnes in 1995 to 503 tonnes in 1996  and 283 tonnes in 1998  i.e. a total decrease by 93 % or 3658 tonnes. Concomitantly  imports of the same product from Taiwan have increased from 1442 tonnes in 1995 to 6920 tonnes in 1996  and 5321 tonnes in 1998  i.e. a total increase over the period by 269 %  or 3879 tonnes. The total decrease of Chinese imports (3658 tonnes) nearly exactly corresponds to the total increase of Taiwanese imports (3879 tonnes). This change in the pattern of trade is alleged to stem from a transhipment of Chinese tube and pipe fittings via Taiwan  where they undergo none or minor modification  for which there is insufficient due course or economic justification other than the existence of the anti-dumping duty of 58 6 % on tube and pipe fitting originating in the PRC. (b) Furthermore  the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping duties on tube and pipe fittings are being undermined in terms of quantities and prices. Indeed  imports of the product subject to investigation consigned from Taiwan have replaced those previously imported from the PRC in terms of quantities; in addition  while prices of imports from the PRC have remained more or less stable over the period 1995 to 1998  prices of imports from Taiwan have decreased by 26 % and have almost reached the level of the Chinese export prices prior to the imposition of measures. (c) Finally  the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence which shows that dumping is taking place in relation to the normal value previously established. E. PROCEDURE (6) In the light of the above  the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the Basic Regulation and to make imports from Taiwan of tube and pipe fittings subject to registration  in accordance with Article 14(5) of the said Regulation. (i) Questionnaires (7) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send questionnaires to Taiwanese exporting producers and traders named in the request. Information  as appropriate  may also be sought from the Community industry. (8) Other interested parties should request a questionnaire from the Commission within 15 days from publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Any request for questionnaires must be made in writing to the address mentioned below and should indicate the name  address  telephone  fax numbers and E-Mail address of the requesting party. (9) The authorities of the PRC as well as of Taiwan will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request. (ii) Certificates of non-circumvention (10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the Basic Regulation  certificates exempting the imports of the product concerned from registration or measures may be issued by the Customs authorities to importers if the importation does not constitute circumvention. (11) Since the issue of this certificate requires the prior authorisation of the Community institutions  requests for such authorisations should be addressed by interested importers to the Commission as early as possible in the course of the investigation so that they may be considered on the basis of a thorough appraisal of their merits. F. REGISTRATION (12) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation imports of the product concerned should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that  should the investigation result in findings of circumvention  anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this investigation on tube and pipe fittings transhipped through Taiwan. G. TIME LIMIT (13) In the interest of sound administration  a period of 40 days from the date of publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Communities shall be fixed within which interested parties  provided they can show that they are likely to be affected by the results of the investigation  may make their views known in writing. The same period shall apply for interested parties who wish to make a written request for a hearing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. H. NON-COOPERATION (14) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  provisional or final findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the marketing year 2003/04. (2) In order to remedy this situation  it is appropriate to grant export refunds in respect of zones which may be supplied by the Community. The particular circumstances of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the refunds  and therefore to apply Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 enabling the amount of the export refund to be fixed by tendering procedure. (3) It should be stated that the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1948/2002(4)  apply to this invitation to tender. (4) With a view to sound market management  the tender should be limited to certain zones listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92/94(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3304/94(6)  while some destinations should be excluded. (5) Under Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(7)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 816/2003(8)  the amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders.

Exports of sugar from the Community to this country also increased significantly in 2001. This development of trade in both directions appeared highly artificial  leading the Commission services to meet in March 2002 and to decide to take action with a view to clarify the situation. (2) By letter dated 8 April 2002  the competent authorities of Serbia and Montenegro were requested to provide explanations for the situation and to fully cooperate with both the Commission and the Member States concerned in dealing with this matter. (3) On 12 April 2002  the Commission called on the Member States to proceed with requests for subsequent verification of proofs of origin concerning sugar imported into the Community from Serbia and Montenegro and to take such precautionary measures as are necessary in order to safeguard the Community's financial interests. (4) On 26 June 2002  the Commission published a notice to importers(3) stating that there was reasonable doubt as to the proper application of the preferential arrangements for sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 which was declared at import as originating in Serbia and Montenegro. (5) Article 2(1)(a) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 subjects the entitlement to benefit from the preferential arrangements to compliance with the definition of the concept of ""originating products"" provided for in Title IV  Chapter 2  section 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(5)  and to the involvement of beneficiaries in effective administrative cooperation with the Community in order to prevent any risk of fraud. (6) Article 110(6) and (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 lays down the responsibility for the competent governmental authorities of the country or territory benefiting from the preferential arrangements to take any steps necessary to verify the origin of the products and to check the other statements of the certificate  including by calling for any documentary evidence or carrying out any checks which they consider appropriate. (7) Article 110(1)  second indent  of that same Regulation lays down the obligation for the beneficiary country or territory to assist the Community by allowing the customs authorities of Member States to verify the authenticity of the proof of origin or the accuracy of the information regarding the true origin of the products in question. Article 122 provides to this end for methods of administrative cooperation  according to which the competent governmental authorities of the beneficiary country or territory shall carry out  on request from the customs authorities of a Member State  subsequent verifications of the authenticity of the proof of origin  the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other relevant requirements. (8) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 states that  where the Commission finds that there is failure to provide administrative cooperation as required for the verification of evidence of origin  or a failure of compliance with the provisions of Article 2(1) of the Regulation by a country or territory covered by the Regulation  it may under certain conditions take measures to suspend in whole or in part the arrangements provided for in the Regulation for a period of three months. (9) According to findings recently made in Serbia and Montenegro  the current system of certification and control of the preferential origin of sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 does not allow the competent authorities of this beneficiary country to verify the originating status of the products and to provide administrative cooperation as required for the verification of evidence of origin. As a consequence of this  it has to be concluded that Serbia and Montenegro does not comply with the provisions of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000. (10) The Commission therefore considers that the conditions laid down in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 are fulfilled and that the preferential arrangements should be suspended for a period of three months  insofar as sugar of CN codes 1701 or 1702 declared as originating in Serbia and Montenegro is concerned.

91,17.2.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 47/3 COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 268/2006 of 14 February 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation)  and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after having consulted the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   PROCEDURE (1) The Council by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 (2) (the definitive Regulation) imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China (original investigation). B.   NEW EXPORTER REVIEWS (2) In the original investigation sampling was applied to the Chinese exporting producers. The non-sampled companies which were granted market economy treatment (MET)  in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation  were attributed the 0 % dumping duty which was established for the sole sampled company which was granted MET. The non-sampled companies which were granted individual treatment (IT)  in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation  received the weighted average duty of 28 6 % established for the sampled companies that were granted IT. A country-wide duty of 47 8 % was imposed on all other companies. (3) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  a new exporter review to determine individual dumping margins could not be initiated in this proceeding  as sampling was used in the original investigation. However  in order to ensure equal treatment between any new exporting producer and the cooperating companies not included in the sample of the original investigation  it is considered that provision should be made in order to respectively impose the duty applicable to the companies which received MET (0 %) or the weighted average duty of companies with IT (28 6 %)  to any new exporting producers which can demonstrate that they meet the criteria set in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation in order to be granted MET or otherwise the criteria of Article 9(5) in order to be granted IT  and that they would therefore be entitled to a review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. C.   UNDERTAKINGS (4) Upon publication of the definitive Regulation  no undertakings could be accepted by the Commission. During the investigation leading to the imposition of definitive measures  several exporting producers had indicated their intention to offer a price undertaking but failed to submit sufficiently substantiated undertaking offers within the deadlines set in Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation. Nevertheless  as set out in recital 152 of the definitive Regulation  the Council  in view of the complexity of the issue for the economic operators in question (predominantly small- and medium-sized enterprises) and given that the definitive disclosure was not preceded by a provisional disclosure  considered that they should exceptionally be allowed to complete their undertaking offers beyond the said deadline. (5) Subsequent to the deadline mentioned above  the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME) together with twenty cooperating companies or groups of cooperating companies offered an acceptable joint undertaking. (6) The Commission by Decision 2006/109/EC (3)  accepted the undertaking offer. The Decision sets out in more detail the reasons for accepting this undertaking. The Council recognises that the undertaking offer eliminates the injurious effect of dumping and limits to a sufficient degree the risk of circumvention. (7) To further enable the Commission to effectively monitor compliance with the undertaking  when the request for release for free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional upon the presentation of a commercial invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex to this Regulation. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that shipments correspond to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty will instead be payable. (8) To further ensure the effective respect of the undertaking  the importers should be made aware that any violation of the undertaking may lead to the retrospective application of the anti-dumping duty for the relevant transactions. Therefore  it is necessary to implement legal provisions providing for the incurrence of a customs debt at the level of the appropriate anti-dumping duty whenever one or more conditions for the exemption are not respected. A customs debt should therefore be incurred whenever the declarant has chosen to release the goods for free circulation  i.e. without collection of anti-dumping duty  and one or several conditions of that undertaking are found to have been violated. (9) In the event of a breach of the undertaking  the anti-dumping duty may be recovered  provided that the Commission has withdrawn the acceptance of the undertaking in accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation  by referring to that particular transaction and  accordingly  by declaring the relevant undertaking invoice as invalid. Therefore  pursuant to Article 14(7) of the basic Regulation  customs authorities should inform the Commission immediately whenever indications of a violation of the undertaking are found. (10) The companies concerned and the CCCME have been informed of the essential facts  considerations and obligations upon which the acceptance of the undertaking is based. (11) It should be noted that in the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking or in case of a withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission  the anti-dumping duty shall automatically apply  pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The application was lodged by Pantech Steel Industries SDN BHD (the applicant)  an exporting producer in Malaysia (the country concerned). B.   PRODUCT (2) The product under review is tube and pipe fittings (other than cast fittings  flanges and threaded fittings)  of iron or steel (not including stainless steel)  with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609 6 mm  of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes  originating in Malaysia (the product concerned)  currently falling within CN codes ex 7307 93 11  ex 7307 93 19  ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90. C.   EXISTING MEASURES (3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1001/2008 (2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Malaysia  including the product concerned produced by the applicant  are subject to a definitive antidumping duty of 75 % with the exception of one company expressly mentioned which is subject to an individual duty rate. D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW (4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based  i.e. the period from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product concerned which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures. (5) The applicant further alleges that it has entered into irrevocable contractual obligations to export the product concerned to the Community in the near future. E.   PROCEDURE (6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received. (7) Having examined the evidence available  the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review  pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  with a view to determine the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and  should dumping be found  the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject. (8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established  it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/2008. (a)   Questionnaires In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant. (b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the parties making themselves known within the period provided for by the present Regulation. F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time  such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation  in order to ensure that  should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant  anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding. G.   TIME LIMITS (10) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: (a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation; (b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. H.   NON-COOPERATION (11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made  in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially  and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA (13) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).

131,COMMISSION DECISION of 31 October 1995 enjoining the German Government to provide all documentation  information and data on the new investment projects of the Volkswagen Group in the new German Länder and on the aid that is to be granted to them (C 62/91 ex NN 75  77  78 and 79/91) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (96/179/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular Articles 5  92 and 93 thereof  Having regard to the Agreement establishing the European Economic Area  and in particular Articles 61 and 62 thereof  Whereas: (1) On 18 December 1991 the Commission took the decision to open a procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EC Treaty with respect to various State aid projects for the benefit of the VW Group in Thüringen and Sachsen (1). By letter dated 29 January 1992  Germany agreed to suspend further payments of aid until the closure of the Article 93 (2) procedure. According to the Commission's information the total aid paid illegally to VW in the form of grants allegedly for the projects Mosel II and Chemnitz II in October and December 1991 amounts to DM 360.8 million (ECU 191 2 million). Furthermore  VW Sachsen has obtained corporation tax refunds to the amount of DM 11 4 million (ECU 6 1 million) and special depreciation on its investments in 1991  where the amount still remains to be determined. (2) On 27 July 1994 the Commission took a final decision within that procedure on the restructuring aid to Sächsische Automobilbau GmbH for its car end engine plants in Mosel (Mosel I) and Chemnitz (Chemnitz I) and the cylinder head plant in Eisenach. At the time of this final decision Germany informed the Commission that the VW Group would finalize its plans on its new investment projects in Mosel and Chemnitz (Mosel II and Chemnitz II) at the end of 1994  so that at that time the relevant information on these projects would be transmitted to the Commission in order for it to assess the proposed regional aid. Before the final decision on the restructuring aid in 1994  the revised plans of VW were presented to the Commission in a preliminary form. The plant layout was to be changed and the investment would only start at the end of 1994. Furthermore  the aid contracts had been revised  so that the grants were reduced to DM 646 8 million for Mosel II and to DM 167 3 million for Chemnitz II. The corporation tax refunds would also fall to DM 106 8 million for Mosel II and to DM 31 9 million for Chemnitz II. This is due to the fact that eligible investment in Mosel II has been reduced to DM 2 812 9 million and to DM 758 8 million in Chemnitz  while projected employment fell to 2 843 in Mosel II and 786 in Chemnitz. (3) At the end of 1994  as well as in the following months  Germany informed the Commission that the investment plans by VW had not been finalized. (4) By letter dated 12 April 1995 the Commission requested Germany to provide VW's plans for the new plants. No reply was received to that letter. (5) By letter dated 4 August 1995  the Commission urgently requested the necessary information  threatening an injunction and eventually a final decision on the basis of the available information in case of non-compliance. In reaction to this letter the German Government informed the Commission by letter dated 22 August 1995 that VW's investment plans were still not finalized. It also stated that under German law a reimbursement of aid would be necessary if VW did not fully execute its investment or employment plans. (6) Under these conditions the Commission concludes that Germany has not submitted the necessary information for the Commission to assess the compatibility of the State aid to the VW Group for its projects Mosel II and Chemnitz II with Article 92 of the EC Treaty. Of this aid  grants to the amount of DM 360 8 million (ECU 191 2 million)  corporation tax refunds to the amount of DM 11 4 million (ECU 6 1 million) and special depreciation on its investments in 1991  where the amount still remains to be determined  have already been paid. The fact that the aid or part of it might have to be reimbursed under German law  if the company did not fully execute its investment or employment plans  is not relevant for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid. (7) In view of the above  and as the Court of Justice has acknowledged in its judgment of 14 February 1990 in Case C-301/87 (France v. Commission) and later confirmed in its judgment of 13 April 1994 in Joined Cases C-324/90 and C-342/90 (2)  where an infringement of Article 93 (3) of the EC Treaty has been committed  the Commission is entitled to take an interim decision requiring the Member State in question  in this case Germany  to suspend payment of the aid and to provide the Commission with all the documents  information and particulars necessary for examining the compatibility of the aid measures with the common market. The Commission takes note that in reaction to the opening of procedure Germany has confirmed by letter dated 29 January 1992 that it would suspend payment of the aid. Furthermore  pursuant to existing case law  should Germany fail to comply with this Decision by not providing all relevant information for the assessment of the compatibility of the abovementioned aid within the deadline of six weeks of the notification of this Decision  the Commission could take a final decision on the basis of the currently available information. Such final decision could include a demand for reimbursement of the aid including interest charged on the amount of aid paid to the company concerned from the date of payment at the percentage value on that date of the reference rate used for the calculation of the net grant equivalent of the various types of aid in that Member State. Such a measure would be necessary in order to restore the status quo (3) by removing all of the financial benefit that has been improperly enjoyed by the recipient of illegal aid since the date that it received the aid ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

135,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 2077/2003 of 27 November 2003 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1)  as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2)  Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 79/2003(4)  and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses  hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price""  should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(5). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Importers have lodged applications for import licences with the competent national authorities between 11 July and 3 p.m.  Brussels time  on 7 September  in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001. (2) The Commission has received from the Member States  pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001  particulars of the numbers and aggregate volume of import licence applications submitted and the total volume imported by traditional importers in 1998 or 1999  the reference years. (3) The Commission is now able  on the basis of that information  to establish uniform quantitative criteria by which the competent national authorities may satisfy licence applications submitted by importers in the Member States for the 2002 quantitative quotas. (4) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by traditional importers for the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction/increase shown in Annex I to the volume of each importer's imports  expressed in quantity or value terms  over the reference period.

144,9.3.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 70/40 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 403/2006 of 8 March 2006 fixing the export refunds on beef and veal THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1)  and in particular Article 33  paragraph 3  third indent  thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulations (EEC) No 32/82 (2)  (EEC) No 1964/82 (3)  (EEC) No 2388/84 (4)  (EEC) No 2973/79 (5) and (EC) No 2051/96 (6) lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products  and the conditions for granting of assistance concerning certain destinations. (3) The increasing shortage of beef and veal on the Community market has pushed prices significantly beyond the basic price as referred to in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999  which represents the desired support level on the Community market. (4) There is increasing general public concern for the welfare of animals which are exported over particularly long distances and for which humane treatment cannot be completely ensured  in particular once they are delivered in third countries. As regards transport  although the conditions for transport of live animals are subject to massive substantive  procedural and control requirements that were reinforced in 2003 experience shows that the respect of animal welfare conditions is not always ensured. Moreover  animal welfare standards in the countries of destination are often lower than in the Community. (5) Exports of live animals for slaughter represent a lower value added for the Community and export refunds granted for the export of those animals imply higher costs for the monitoring and control of animal welfare conditions. Therefore  in order to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the internal market  as well as the welfare of animals  exports of live animals for slaughter to third countries should no longer be encouraged by virtue of export refunds. (6) As to live animals for reproduction  in order to prevent any abuse  export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age. (7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2147/2005 of 23 December 2005 fixing the export refunds on beef and veal (7) should therefore be repealed. (8) In order to enable some Community beef and veal products to be disposed of on the international market  export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some products under CN codes 0201  0202 and 1602 50. (9) The uptake of export refunds for certain categories of beef and veal products proves to be insignificant. This is also the case with regard to the uptake for certain destinations very close to the Community territory. For such categories  export refunds should no longer be fixed. (10) The refunds provided for in this Regulation are set on the basis of the product codes as defined in the nomenclature adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds (8). (11) The refunds on all frozen cuts should be in line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals. (12) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (9). (13) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore  to be eligible for a refund  products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (10)  Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products (11) and Council Directive 94/65/EC of 14 December 1994 laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations (12). (14) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82  the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %  but not less than 85 %  of the total weight of cuts produced by boning. (15) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished. That abolition should not  however  lead to a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

148,COMMISSION  DECISION of 5 March 1986 authorizing Spain to adopt protective measures in respect of imports of certain steel products (Only the Spanish text is authentic) (86/97/ECSC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community  Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal  and in particular Article 379 thereof  Whereas  by letter of 3 March 1986  the Spanish Government applied to the Commission for authorization to adopt  pursuant to Article 379 of the Act of Accession  protective measures in the sector of steel products; Whereas in their application the Spanish authorities provided the Commission with information enabling the latter to establish that the Spanish steel industry is currently experiencing serious difficulties that are likely to persist; Whereas  pursuant to Commission Decision No 3485/85/ECSC (1)  production by Spanish undertakings is subject to a system of monitoring; whereas  pursuant to Commission Decision No 3717/83/ECSC (2)  which has been applicable to Spanish undertakings since 1 March 1986  deliveries of certain products must be accompanied by a production certificate and an accompanying document; Whereas deliveries to Spain from steel undertakings in the other Member States have increased sharply since January 1986; whereas import certificates issued for the month of January for the products in these sectors involve quantities of around 400 000 tonnes; whereas according to the figures provided by the Spanish Government actual deliveries in January amounted to some 261 000 tonnes; whereas deliveries of these products in recent years have averaged 100 000 tonnes a month; Whereas deliveries of the products concerned have thus risen sharply by about 160 % on average since accession; whereas this rise has been particularly marked for the sectors covered by categories Ia  Ib and II  as defined in Decision No 3485/85/ECSC; Whereas Spanish steel undertakings are currently in the process of restructuring and hence highly vulnerable; whereas the rise in deliveries of steel products from the other Member States is liable to jeopardize this process of restructuring; whereas the volume of deliveries of products from the other Member States is one of the main reasons for the difficulties indicated by the Spanish authorities in their application; whereas if no immediate action is taken these difficulties are likely to persist; Whereas  under the circumstances  a quantitative restriction on deliveries from the other Member States should allow Spanish steel undertakings to continue their process of restructuring along the lines of the plans referred to in Protocol No 10 attached to the Act of Accession and to redress the situation; whereas this measure should allow the sector  and in particular the undertakings concerned  to adapt to the economy of the common market; Whereas it is sufficient for the quantitative restriction to apply to categories Ia  Ib and II  as defined by Decision No 3485/85/ECSC  given that the increase in deliveries from the other Member States is concentrated in these three categories; Whereas authorization of a quantitative restriction up to 31 December 1986 will serve the desired purpose; Whereas an extension to Spanish undertakings and the Spanish steel market of the quota system applicable to undertakings in the other Member States could help to solve the problems of Spanish steel undertakings; whereas the Commission will take the necessary measures to apply that system to these undertakings as soon as possible; Whereas in addition to these restrictions on deliveries there is the system of surveillance of products originating in non-member countries established by Commission Recommendation No 3658/85/ECSC (3); whereas this system should be reinforced by more rapid provision of information to the Commission; Whereas the provisions adopted may not under any circumstances restrict deliveries of each of the products in question to a level below that of actual imports in 1984; Whereas  to achieve an equitable distribution of the authorized quantities both among the Member States and among the operators concerned  the existing patterns of trade must be respected yet account must also be taken of the interests of any new operators; Whereas the situation is so grave that the protective measures must apply even to current contracts; whereas  to avoid additional prejudice to the operators concerned  this Decision must not affect goods already in shipment; whereas  however  the Spanish authorities should be allowed the possibility of taking into account the total volume of these shipments for the purposes of distribution of total quantities; Whereas the proper application of the provisions of this Decision requires the establishment of highly specific implementation and management rules; whereas  to prevent the disturbance in the market of the products in question from worsening  the quantities admitted into Spain up to the end of 1986 should be distributed by quarter  the quantities of the second quarter of 1986 also comprising the quantities for the days in March after this Decision takes effect; whereas  to allow adjustment to demand  it should also be possible to transfer authorizaions between the categories stipulated by this Decision up to 5 % of the limit established for each category; Whereas the proper application of this Decision requires the establishment of joint information and consultation procedures by the Commission and the Spanish authorities; Whereas  since this Decision can only be justified if the condition of application referred to in Article 379 of the Act of Accession are still present  the Commission may be prompted to amend or rescind it; whereas the Commission must therefore keep a constant check on the facts underlying this Decision; Whereas the Commission is obliged to take  in the first place  measures which least disrupt the functioning of the common market; whereas  in the light of the examination that the Commission has conducted of the economic difficulties  the restrictions adopted constitute measures which  while enabling the desired result to be obtained  least disturb the functioning of the common market ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

163,17.6.2005 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 154/3 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 905/2005 of 16 June 2005 determining for the 2004/2005 marketing year actual production of unginned cotton and the ensuing guide price reduction THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to the Act of Accession of Greece  and in particular Protocol 4 on cotton (1)  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 of 22 May 2001 on production aid for cotton (2)  and in particular the third indent of Article 19(2) thereof  Whereas: (1) The first subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the cotton aid scheme (3) provides that actual production in each marketing year and the reduction in the guide price referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 are to be established before 15 June of that year. (2) The second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 states the terms on which the quantity of unginned cotton produced is to be reckoned as the actual production. (3) The Greek authorities  using fibre yield as a quality criterion  have recognised 1 135 534 tonnes of unginned cotton as eligible for aid. (4) The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that on 15 May 2005 they did not recognise as eligible for aid 34 142 tonnes of unginned cotton consisting of 6 172 tonnes from 2 364 9 hectares not declared in line with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001  22 746 tonnes in respect of which national area reduction measures under Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were disregarded  3 580 tonnes which were not of sound and fair merchantable quality in accordance with Article 15(1) of that Regulation  and 1 644 tonnes from 2 040 hectares from areas in respect of which financial compensation was paid to the growers on account of damage due to natural causes. (5) Exclusion from actual production of the abovementioned 1 644 tonnes of unginned cotton is not justified. This quantity comes from parcels declared under Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and was actually delivered to the ginning plants. The very low yield in tonnes of unginned cotton of the parcels affected by the damage is an important indication that the parcels nevertheless generated some produce. Therefore  that quantity meets the criteria laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must accordingly be added to the quantity of 1 135 534 tonnes. (6) In consequence  actual Greek production of unginned cotton for the 2004/2005 marketing year must be considered to total 1 137 229 tonnes. (7) The Spanish authorities  using fibre yield as a quality criterion  have recognised 368 084 tonnes of unginned cotton as eligible for aid. (8) The Spanish authorities have informed the Commission that on 15 May 2005 they did not recognise as eligible for aid 1 638 tonnes of unginned cotton consisting of 1 612 tonnes in respect of which national area reduction measures under Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were disregarded  six tonnes that were not of sound and fair merchantable quality in accordance with Article 15(1) of that Regulation  seven tonnes that were not declared in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001  and 13 tonnes because the rules concerning contracts referred to in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were not complied with. (9) Exclusion from actual production of the abovementioned 13 tonnes of unginned cotton on account of non-compliance with the rules concerning contracts is not justified. Moreover  this quantity meets the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must therefore be added to the quantity of 368 084 tonnes. (10) In consequence  by application of fibre yield as a quality criterion actual Spanish production of unginned cotton in the 2004/2005 marketing year must be considered to total 368 097 tonnes. (11) The Spanish authorities  using fibre yield as a quality criterion  have recognised 982 tonnes of unginned cotton from crop areas in Portugal as eligible for aid. This quantity meets the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must accordingly be regarded as actual Portuguese production of unginned cotton for the 2004/2005 marketing year. (12) Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 provides that if the sum of the actual production determined for Spain and Greece exceeds 1 031 000 tonnes the guide price indicated in Article 3(1) of that Regulation is to be reduced in any Member State where actual production exceeds the guaranteed national quantity. (13) Moreover  if the sum of actual production in Spain and Greece reduced by 1 031 000 tonnes is higher than 469 000 tonnes  the reduction in the guide price of 50 % increases gradually in accordance with the rules laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001. (14) For the 2004/05 marketing year the guaranteed national quantity is exceeded in both Spain and Greece. Actual production in Spain is in the second step of 4. 830 tonnes above its guaranteed national quantity increased by 113 000 tonnes. As a result  the guide price reduction in Spain should be 54 %. In the case of Greece  actual production is below its guaranteed national quantity increased by 356 000 tonnes. As a result  the guide price reduction in Greece should be 50 %.

(2) Under Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 refunds can be granted on products exported by the Community  to the extent necessary to enable economically significant quantities to be exported and within the limits ensuing from agreements concluded in line with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) In line with Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 care should be taken to ensure that trade flows already engendered by the granting of refunds are not disturbed. For that reason and given the seasonal nature of fruit and vegetable exports quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3). In setting quantities account must be taken of perishability. (4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 stipulates that when refunds are set account is to be taken of the existing situation and outlook for prices and availability of fruit and vegetables on the Community market and for international trade prices  of marketing and transport costs and of the economic aspects of the exportation envisaged. (5) Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 requires Community market prices to be determined using the prices that are most favourable from the point of view of exportation. (6) The international trade situation or specific requirements of certain markets may necessitate differentiation of the refund on a given product by destination. (7) Economically significant exports can at present be made of shelled almonds  hazelnuts and walnuts in shell. (8) Since nuts have a relatively long storage life export refunds can be set at longer intervals. (9) In order to permit the best possible use of available resources the export refunds should  given the structure of exportation from the Community  be set using system A1.

PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EC) No 2451/95 (2) the Commission initiated an investigation concerning the circumvention of the anti-dumping duties imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2861/93 (3) on imports of certain magnetic disks (3 5&Prime; microdisks) originating in Japan  Taiwan and the People's Republic of China by the same product from Canada  Hong Kong  India  Indonesia  Macao  Malaysia  the Philippines  Singapore and Thailand and instructed customs authorities  pursuant to Articles 13 (3) and 14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 to register the imports covered by the investigation. The investigation was initiated following a request lodged by the Committee of European Diskette Manufacturers (Diskma). (2) The request contained prima facie evidence of a change in the pattern of trade between the countries concerned and the Community which sole due cause or justification was the existence of anti-dumping duties  and of transhipments through these countries to the Community of 3 5&Prime; microdisks manufactured in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The request also showed that the imports from the countries concerned were being dumped in relation to the normal values previously established and were undermining the remedial effects of the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of 3 5&Prime; microdisks originating in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. This evidence was considered to be sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation. (3) The product concerned is 3 5&Prime; microdisks  used to record and store encoded digital computer information  currently classifiable within CN code ex 8523 20 90. (4) The Commission officially advised the exporters known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting countries about the initiation of the investigation and sent questionnaires to known exporters. (5) The investigation covered the period 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995. B. INVESTIGATION (6) The Commission received replies from the following exporters: (a) Canada: KAO Infosystems Canada Inc.  Ontario; (b) Hong Kong: Jackin Magnetic Company Ltd  Hong Kong Plantron (HK) Ltd  Hong Kong Magnetic Ltd  Benelux Manufacturing Limited  Prime Standard Ltd; (c) India: Allied Electronics & Magnetics Ltd  Udaipur  Moser-Baer India Ltd  New Delhi  Sujata Data Products Ltd  Bombay; (d) Indonesia: P.T. Beneluxindo  Djakarta; (e) Malaysia: Discomp  Kuala Lumpur  KUB Microeletronics Sdn. Bhd  Kuala Lumpur  Mega High-Tech Corp. (M) Sdn. Bhd  Penang; (f) Philippines: Maxi Data Philippines Inc.  Manila; (g) Singapore: Datapulse Technology Ltd  Singapore  General Magnetics Limited  Singapore  Goldtron Magmedia Pte. Ltd  Singapore  MJC (Singapore) Pte. Ltd  Singapore; (h) Thailand: General Mediatech Co. Ltd  Bangkok  V-SA Cast Co. Ltd  Bangkok  V-SA Magnetic Co. Ltd  Bangkok. V-SA Magnetic was a subsidiary of V-SA Cast which held more than 50 % of the shares of V-SA Magnetic. No exporter from Macao replied to the Commission's questionnaire. With the exception of the companies located in Canada and the Philippines the Commission verified all the information submitted at the premises of the exporters mentioned above. C. RESULTS Canada  India  Philippines and Singapore (7) The Community industry alleged in its request to initiate the circumvention investigation that the combined market share of Canada  India  Philippines and Singapore was 4 5 % of Community consumption in 1994. However  based on the latest external trade statistics of the Community (Comext)  the Commission established that the market share of these countries only amounted to 2 8 % during the investigation period  and thus it was less than the de minimis import volume referred to in Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 for which injury shall normally be regarded as negligible. Furthermore  it was established that the imported quantities from these countries were also below the de minimis thresholds of Article 5 (8) of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994 of 3 % of total imports of the like product into the Community on a per country basis  and of 7 % for all four countries taken together. (8) On this basis  the Commission considered it unlikely in this case that the imports from the four countries concerned could undermine in terms of quantities the remedial effects of the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. Hong Kong (9) Jackin Magnetic and Plantron (HK) were found to be genuine producers of microdisks which accounted for about 90 % of total Hong Kong's export volume to the Community during the investigation period. No evidence of transhipments of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of these two companies. Furthermore  it was established that for each company the parts imported from the countries subject to the anti-dumping duties constituted less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the assembled product. (10) Hong Kong Magnetic is a trading company which sold microdisks to the Community. However  no evidence of transhipments to the Community of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of this company. (11) Benelux Manufacturing and its subsidiary Prime Standard were found to be related to the Indonesian producer/exporter P. T. Beneluxindo (see recital 14) and to have sold microdisks to the Community. However  no evidence of transhipments to the Community of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of these two companies in Hong Kong. (12) Another company which was related to the Thai exporter V-SA Magnetic  refused to cooperate in the investigation (see recital 18). The Commission services will continue to monitor closely the situation in this respect. (13) In view of these findings  it was established that the companies investigated did not fulfil the criteria set out in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 according to which imports of the product concerned transhipped through or assembled in third countries respectively could be considered to constitute circumvention. Furthermore  in view of the development of the imports of microdisks from Hong Kong into the Community which decreased from 2 816 tonnes in 1993 to 1 212 tonnes during the investigation period  it seems unlikely that these imports could undermine in terms of quantities the remedial effects of the anti-dumping duties imposed on the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. Indonesia (14) The sole exporter/producer investigated in Indonesia  P. T. Beneluxindo  accounted for the vast majority of the recorded imports into the Community during the investigation period. P. T. Beneluxindo is a subsidiary of Benelux Manufacturing Limited  Hong Kong which supplied P. T. Beneluxindo with all the parts used for the assembly of microdisks. All finished microdisks were then sent back to Hong Kong and sold from there by the sales subsidiary of Benelux Manufacturing Limited  Prime Standard Ltd  to independent customers in the Community. The company was found to be a genuine producer and it was established that the parts imported from the People's Republic of China and Taiwan constituted far less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the assembled product. Furthermore  no evidence of transhipments of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of P. T. Beneluxindo. Therefore  the conditions for circumvention outlined in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 have not been met in respect of the companies investigated. Macao (15) No company in Macao cooperated in the investigation. In these circumstances the Commission would normally be entitled to propose the extension of the anti-dumping measures to this country in order to avoid that circumvention continues. However  following an investigation by the anti-fraud services of the Commission (Uclaf)  anti-dumping duties will be applied retroactively on imports of Chinese microdisks exported from Macao. Therefore  it is reasonable to assume that the remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures will not be significantly undermined by imports from Macao  the quantities which have fallen sharply following the anti-circumvention investigation period. In any event  the Commission will continue to monitor closely the development of imports into the Community of microdisks from Macao. Malaysia (16) The three exporters/producers investigated in Malaysia accounted for nearly all the recorded imports from this country into the Community during the investigation period. While two of these producers were not related to any exporter/producer in the countries subject to the anti-dumping duties  the third one (Mega High-Tech Corp.) was a subsidiary of a Taiwanese company. All three were found to be genuine producers and it was established that the parts imported from the People's Republic of China and Taiwan constituted far less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the product assembled by each producer. Moreover  no evidence of transhipments of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of any of the Malaysian producers concerned. Consequently the conditions for circumvention outlined in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 have not been met in respect of the companies investigated. Thailand (17) The three companies investigated in Thailand accounted for the vast majority of all the recorded imports into the Community from this country during the investigation period. The subsidiary of V-SA Cast  V-SA magnetic (see recital 6 (h))  and General Mediatech were found to be genuine producers and the parts of Chinese or Taiwanese origin used in the assembly of microdisks constituted less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the assembled product by each of these companies. In addition  no evidence of transhipment of the finished product from the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect to these two companies. (18) V-SA Cast was found to have transhipped 28 million microdisks supplied by a company located in Hong Kong which held 15 % of V-SA Magnetic shares. However  given the lack of cooperation of the related company in Hong Kong  no evidence could be found which indicated that the microdisks concerned were of Chinese or Taiwanese origin. The presumption of such origin would seem to be excessively punitive for the Thai company  taking account of its efforts to persuade the Hong Kong company to cooperate in the investigation and the small shareholding by this latter company in the V-SA group. In view of the above the Commission considers that the conditions for circumvention outlined in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 have not been met in respect of the companies investigated. D. TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION (19) In the light of the above findings and considerations made in respect of the nine countries subject to the circumvention investigation  it appears appropriate that the latter be terminated without extension to any of those countries of the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of microdisks originating in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The registration of imports of microdisks from these countries introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2451/95 shall cease. (20) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection. (21) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the investigation and have been given the opportunity to comment ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts.

Protocol 2 was amended by the Protocol adjusting the Europe Agreement  hereinafter referred to as the ""Adjusting Protocol""  approved by Council Decision 98/677/EC(2)  and by Decision No 5/2001 of the EU-Lithuania Association Council(3). (2) A trade agreement has recently been concluded which amends the Adjusting Protocol. The agreement aims to improve economic convergence in preparation for the accession of Lithuania to the European Union and is scheduled to enter into force not later than 1 July 2003. On the Community side that agreement lays down concessions in the form of complete liberalisation of trade for certain processed agricultural products and duty-free quotas for others. For imports outside of those quotas the provisions laid down in Protocol 2 continue to apply. (3) The procedure for adopting a decision to amend the Adjusting Protocol will not be completed in time for it to enter into force on 1 July 2003. It is therefore necessary to provide for the application of the tariff concessions made to Lithuania on an autonomous basis as from 1 July 2003. (4) For the imports of certain agricultural products no duties should be applied and for others duty-free quotas should be opened. (5) On processed agricultural products covered by Protocol 2 but not listed in this regulation or for which the quotas opened by this Regulation are exhausted the trade provision laid down in Protocol 2 should continue to apply.

It provides that the commodities covered by that Regulation (‘the commodities’) are only to be imported into  and transit through  the Community from third countries  territories  zones or compartments which are free from disease and are listed in the table in Part 1 of Annex I thereto. In addition  model veterinary certificates are set out in Part 2 of that Annex. Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 also provides that where examination  sampling and testing for certain diseases are required for imports of the commodities  they are to be carried out in accordance with Annex III thereto. (2) Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 provides that the commodities may only be imported into the Community where the third country informs the Commission of any initial outbreaks of Newcastle Disease or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and submits virus isolates to the Community reference laboratory for avian influenza and Newcastle disease. (3) Where an outbreak of avian influenza is detected on the territory of a third country  or a zone or compartment(s) thereof  the competent authority of that third country may no longer certify that its territory  zone or compartment(s) thereof  as listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008  is free from that disease. (4) In the interests of animal health and the prevention and monitoring of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) at Community level  it is appropriate that initial outbreaks of that disease be reported to the Commission. Article 7 of Regulation (EC) 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly. (5) Canada has demonstrated its capability to respond to outbreaks of LPAI in poultry holdings on its territory and to successfully prevent the spread of infection. (6) Canada has also provided the Commission with detailed information on the epidemiological situation and the disease control measures taken by it  including a description of the areas placed under official restrictions in relation to outbreaks of LPAI. (7) Council Decision 1999/201/EC of 14 December 1998 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in respect of trade in live animals and animal products (4) approved that Agreement  which provides that each Party to it is to recognise a sanitary measure of the other Party as equivalent if the latter objectively demonstrates that its measure achieves the appropriate level of protection. (8) In view of that Agreement and the disease control system put in place in Canada  it is appropriate to apply alternative certification provisions for day-old chicks and hatching eggs originating from areas outside those placed under official restrictions for LPAI. Accordingly  the model veterinary certificates for day-old chicks other than ratites and hatching eggs of poultry other than ratites should be amended to allow for alternative certification provisions for Canada in the case of future outbreaks of LPAI. (9) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has recently issued recommendations on certain treatment procedures for the commodities for the inactivation of disease agents. The model veterinary certificate for egg products should therefore be amended in order to take account of those recommendations. (10) Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly. (11) In addition  the testing method for a Salmonella subspecies of animal health relevance should be amended to allow third countries to use laboratory methods as recommended by the OIE. Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly. (12) In addition  a footnote should be corrected in the model veterinary certificate for transit/storage of specified pathogen-free eggs  meat  minced meat and mechanically separated meat of poultry  ratites and wild game-birds  eggs and egg products. Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly. (13) Furthermore  it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period to permit Member States and industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the applicable veterinary certification. (14) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

213,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 108/2004 of 22 January 2004 fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1)  and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial. (8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation. (9) Import duties and export refunds still apply to certain sugar products traded between the Community  of the one part  and the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia  hereinafter referred to as ""new Member States""  of the other part  and the level of export refunds is appreciably greater than the level of import duties. In view of the accession of these countries to the Community on 1 May 2004  the appreciable gap between the level of import duties and the level of export refunds granted for the products in question may result in speculative trade flows. (10) To prevent any abuse through the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund or levy should be set for all the new Member States for the products covered by this Regulation. (11) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

In fixing this maximum the criteria provided for in Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 must be taken into account. A contract is awarded to any tenderer whose tender is equal to or less than the maximum reduction in the duty.

(3) In the light of current market needs in Spain  an invitation to tender for the reduction in the duty on imports of sorghum should be opened.

If that benefit is combined with the benefit resulting from the invitations to tender for the reduction in the import duty  this is likely to disturb the Spanish market for cereals.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.

PROCEDURE (1) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of sacks and bags originating in the People's Republic of China  India  Indonesia and Thailand(2)  the Commission received on 8 July 2002 a request to review these measures pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the Basic Regulation). (2) The request was lodged by the European Association for Textile Polyolefins (EATP) on behalf of Community producers representing 32 03 % of the total Community production of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene. (3) The request contained prima facie evidence showing that there would be a continuation or recurrence of injurious dumping should measures be allowed to lapse  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an expiry review. (4) Accordingly  the Commission  after consultation of the Advisory Committee  initiated by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports into the Community of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene  currently classifiable within CN codes 6305 32 81  6305 33 91  ex 3923 21 00  ex 3923 29 10 and ex 3923 29 90 originating in the People's Republic of China  India  Indonesia and Thailand. (5) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers  importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country  the representative users and the Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) By a letter dated 22 October 2003 to the Commission  the EATP formally withdrew its request for an expiry review concerning imports of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene originating in the People's Republic of China  India  Indonesia and Thailand. (7) According to Article 9(1) and Article 11(2) of the Basic Regulation  a proceeding may be terminated where the request for a review is withdrawn  unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. (8) It was considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. However  no comments were received from any party. Consequently  there is no indication that the termination of the measures would not be in the Community interest. (9) It was therefore concluded that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene originating in the People's Republic of China  India  Indonesia and Thailand should be terminated and that the existing measures should be repealed ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The application was lodged by Yingkou Dalmond Refractories Co.  Ltd (the applicant)  an exporting producer in the People’s Republic of China (the country concerned). B.   PRODUCT (2) The product under review is chemically bonded  unfired magnesia bricks  whose magnesia component contains at least 80 % MgO  whether or not containing magnesite originating in the People’s Republic of China (the product concerned)  currently classifiable within CN codes ex 6815 91 00  ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90 (TARIC codes 6815910010  6815991020 and 6815999020). These CN codes are given only for information. C.   EXISTING MEASURES (3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 (2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China  including the product concerned produced by the applicant  are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 39 9 % with the exception of several companies specially mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates. D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW (4) The applicant alleges that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively claims individual treatment in conformity with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation  that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based  i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the above mentioned anti-dumping measures. (5) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period. E.   PROCEDURE (6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above mentioned application and have been given an opportunity to comment. (7) Having examined the evidence available  the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review  pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  with a view to determining whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively whether the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation and  if so  the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and  should dumping be found  the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject. (8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established  it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005. (a) Questionnaires (b) Collection of information and holding of hearings (c) Market economy status (d) Selection of the market economy country F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time  such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation  in order to ensure that  should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicants  anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding. G.   TIME LIMITS (10) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: — interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mention in Article 4(1) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  — interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission  — interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of the United States of America which  in the event that the applicant will not be granted market economy status  is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People’s Republic of China  — the applicant should submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy status. H.   NON-COOPERATION (11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made  in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially  and use of facts available is made  the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.

253,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1708/2003 of 26 September 2003 fixing the coefficients applicable to cereals exported in the form of Irish whiskey for the period 2003/2004 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1104/2003(2)  Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 of 15 October 1993 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the fixing and granting of adjusted refunds in respect of cereals exported in the form of certain spirit drinks(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1633/2000(4)  and in particular Article 5 thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 lays down that the quantities of cereals eligible for the refund shall be the quantities placed under control and distilled  weighted by a coefficient to be fixed annually for each Member State concerned. The coefficient shall express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned  on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question. On the basis of the information supplied by Ireland on the period from 1 January to 31 December 2002  the average ageing period in 2002 was five years for Irish whiskey. The coefficients for the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 should therefore be fixed accordingly. (2) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area(5) precludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein  Iceland and Norway. Moreover  the Community has concluded with certain third countries agreements abolishing export refunds. According to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93  this should be taken into account in the calculation of the coefficients for the period 2003/2004.

(2) According to the information received by the Commission  catches of the stock referred to in the Annex to this Regulation by vessels flying the flag of or registered in the Member State referred to therein have exhausted the quota allocated for 2006.

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination. (4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (5) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For those two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

In fixing this maximum  the criteria provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 must be taken into account.

(2) That complementary quantity should be calculated in accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/07  2007/08 and 2008/09 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements (2)  on the basis of an exhaustive Community forecast supply balance for raw sugar. (3) For the 2007/08 marketing year  the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar for refining of 286 597 tonnes in white sugar equivalent so that the Community refineries’ supply needs can be met. This complementary quantity includes an estimation of applications for import licences in the final months of the 2007/08 marketing year  concerning imports referred to in Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1100/2006 of 17 July 2006 laying down  for the marketing years 2006/07  2007/08 and 2008/09  detailed rules for the opening and administration of tariff quotas for raw cane sugar for refining  originating in least developed countries  as well as detailed rules applying to the importation of products of tariff heading 1701 originating in least developed countries (3).

It is therefore appropriate to fix the final quantity of complementary sugar of 86 597 tonnes for the marketing year 2007/08. (5) Adequate supply of the refineries can only be guaranteed if the traditional export agreements between the beneficiary countries are respected. Therefore a breakdown between the beneficiary countries or group of countries is needed. For India  a quantity of 6 000 tonnes is opened which brings the total quantity for the marketing year 2007/08 for India to 20 000 tonnes which is considered an economically viable shipping quantity. The remaining quantities should be fixed for the ACP States  which have collectively undertaken to implement between themselves procedures for the allocation of the quantities in order to ensure the appropriate supply of the refineries. (6) Prior to the import of this complementary sugar  the refiners need to make supply and shipping arrangements with the beneficiary countries and trade. In order to allow them to prepare for the application for import licences in due time  it is appropriate to provide for the entry into force of this Regulation as from the date of its publication.

274,Commission Regulation (EC) No 119/2003 of 23 January 2003 fixing the export refunds on pigmeat THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2)  and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for these products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in pigmeat that the refund should be fixed as set out below. (3) In the case of products falling within CN code 0210 19 81  the refund should be limited to an amount which takes account of the qualitative characteristics of each of the products falling within these codes and of the foreseeable trend of production costs on the world market. It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81. (4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries  which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602  the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances  to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations. (5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination. (6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2002(4). (7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore  to be eligible for a refund  products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5)  as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6)  Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8)  as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).

(2) Under Article 64(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999  the amounts and destinations for refunds are to be fixed periodically taking account of the existing situation and likely trends with regard to the prices and availability of the products concerned on the Community market and the world market prices for those products.

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(2) In Spain and Greece  countries that produce together more than two thirds of the olive oil produced in the EU  the average olive oil price recorded on the market during the period specified in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 of 20 August 2008 laying down common rules for the granting of private storage aid for certain agricultural products (2)  is below the level indicated in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and that fact causes a serious disturbance on the markets of these countries. Furthermore  a serious disturbance of the market is observed in Italy  France and Portugal as the expectation of falling prices leads traders to postpone all purchases that are not immediately required. (3) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that aid for private storage may be granted for olive oil and that the aid should be fixed by the Commission in advance or by means of a tendering procedure.

Pursuant to Article 6 of that Regulation  a tendering procedure is to be opened in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in its Article 9. (5) The global quantity up to which private storage aid can be granted should be set at a level which  according to market analysis  would contribute to the stabilisation of the market. (6) In order to facilitate the administrative and control work relating to the conclusion of contracts  the minimum quantity of product each tender must provide for should be fixed. (7) A security should be fixed in order to ensure that the operators fulfil their contractual obligations and that the measure will have its desired effect on the market. (8) In the light of the evolution of the market situation in the current marketing year and the forecasts for the following marketing year  the Commission should have the possibility to decide to shorten the term of contracts which are being performed and adjust the level of aid accordingly. That possibility has to be included in the contract  as provided for by Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008. (9) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008  the time period of notification of all valid tenders by Member States to the Commission is to be fixed.

308,"Commission Decision of 22 May 2003 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable compact disks originating in India (2003/371/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2)  and in particular Article 9 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) On 17 May 2002  the Commission announced  by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3)  the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of recordable compact disks (CD-Rs) originating in India. (2) The proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged in April 2002 by the Committee of CD-R manufacturers (CECMA)  acting on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of CD-Rs. The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the said product and of material injury resulting therefrom  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (3) There are definitive anti-dumping measures currently in force on imports of CD-Rs originating in Taiwan (Council Regulation (EC) No 1050/2002(4)). A parallel anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Community of the same product originating in India was initiated by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(5) on the same date of the initiation of the anti-dumping proceeding referred to in recital 1. (4) The Commission officially advised the applicant and the other known Community producers  the exporting producer  importers  users and suppliers known to be concerned as well as the representatives of India of the initiation of the proceeding. The parties directly concerned were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (5) The exporting producer in India  as well as the applicant and other Community producers  importers  consumers association and suppliers  made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested within the above time limit and indicated that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing. (6) Certain parties contended that the applicant Community producers did not fulfil the requirements of Article 5(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (basic Regulation) and that the initiation of the investigation was not warranted. In this respect  it should be noted that both statutory pre-initiation thresholds  namely the 25 % and 50 % thresholds of Article 5(4)  were met and  therefore  the investigation could be initiated. (7) The Commission sought  by means of questionnaires sent to all known parties  and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping  injury and Community interest. In this regard  the Commission carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies: (a) Exporting producer in India: - Moser Baer India Ltd.  New Delhi  India; (b) Producers in the Community: - Computer Support Italcard SRL  Milan  Italy  - C.D.A DatentrĂ¤ger Albrechts GmbH  Albrechts  Germany  - CPO Magnetic Products BV  Oosterhout  the Netherlands  - Fuji Magnetics GmbH  Kleve  Germany  - Mitsui Advanced Media SA  Ensisheim  France  - MPO Media SAS  Averton  France  - TDK Recording Media Europe SA  Bascharage  Luxembourg  - Prime Disc Technologies GmbH  Wiesbaden  Germany  - IMAG Optical Storage Ltd  Limerick  Ireland  - Multimedia Info-Tech Ltd  Belfast  Northern Ireland; (c) Suppliers in the Community: - Bayer AG  Leverkusen  Germany  - Steag Hamatech  Sternenfels  Germany  (8) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002 (investigation period or IP). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 1998 to the end of the investigation period. B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT 1. Product under consideration (9) The product under consideration is recordable compact discs (CD-Rs) currently classifiable under CN code ex 8523 90 00. (10) A CD-R is a polycarbonate disc  which is coated with a layer of dye  a layer of reflective material such as gold or silver and a protective layer. Recording on such a disk can be done only once and therefore the disc is said to be of the type WORM (Write Once Read Many). The disc is an optical storage medium for digital data or music. Recording is realised by exposing the dye-layer to an infrared laser beam in a CD-R recorder. CD-Rs can be distinguished according to the type of data stored (data CD-R versus music CD-R)  the storage capacity  the reflective metal layer (mainly silver) and whether or not the CD-R is printed upon. The product is also sold in different qualities and comes on the market in different types of packaging of which the most frequently encountered are regular or slim jewel cases containing one CD-R  shrink-wrapped spindles of 10 to 100 CD-Rs  cake-boxes of 10 to 100 CD-Rs  envelopes containing one CD-R packed in cellophane  or in a carton or paper sleeve  etc. Although the use and the quality of the various types of CD-Rs sold may differ  this does not entail any significant differences in the basic physical and technical characteristics of the different types. They are therefore considered as one product for the purpose of this investigation. 2. Like product (11) The investigation showed that CD-Rs produced and sold on the domestic market of India have similar basic physical and technical characteristics and uses compared with that exported from this country to the Community. Similarly  CD-Rs manufactured by the applicant and other Community producers and sold on the Community market have similar basic physical and technical characteristics and uses when compared to these exported to the Community from the country in question. (12) Consequently  CD-Rs sold on the domestic market of India and exported to the Community as well as CD-Rs produced and sold in the Community are considered as a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. C. DUMPING (13) The investigation has shown that Moser Baer India Ltd. is the sole exporting producer of the product concerned in India. 1. Normal value (14) In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation  the Commission first examined whether the domestic sales of CD-Rs to independent customers by the sole exporting producer were representative  i.e. whether the total volume of such sales was equal to or greater than 5 % of the total volume of the corresponding export sales to the Community. (15) This assessment revealed that the exporting producer had representative sales of CD-Rs on the domestic market during the IP. (16) The Commission considered domestically sold and exported product types  which had similar storage capacity  metal layer  printing  quality and uses  as being directly comparable. (17) Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable product type exported to the Community. (18) The Commission subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of the exporting producer could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. This was done by establishing the proportion of domestic sales to independent customers  of each exported product type  sold at a loss on the domestic market during the IP. For those product types where more than 80 % by volume of sales on the domestic market were not below unit costs  and where the weighted average sales price was equal to or higher than the weighted average production cost  normal value  by product type  was calculated as the weighted average of all domestic sales prices of the type in question. (19) For all types exported to the Community  domestic sales were found to have been made in the ordinary course of trade. Normal value was  therefore  based for the corresponding product type on the actual prices paid or payable  by independent customers in the domestic market of India  during the IP  as set out in Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation. (20) Where necessary  the manufacturing costs and the selling  general and administrative (SG& A) expenses reported were corrected before being used in the ordinary course of trade test. 2. Export price (21) Certain exports of the product under consideration by the exporting producer were made directly to independent customers in the Community and consequently the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation  on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. (22) The exporting producer also sold the product concerned to related parties in the Community. For these exports  the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation  on the basis of prices at which the imported products were first resold to an independent buyer. For this purpose  adjustments were made to take account of all costs  including duties and taxes  incurred between importation and resale  and of profits normally accruing  so that a reliable export price could be established. 3. Comparison (23) The comparison between normal value and export price for the exporting producer concerned was made on an ex-factory basis. For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price  due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. In this respect  allowances for differences in transport costs  ocean freight and insurance costs  handling  loading and ancillary costs  packing costs  credit costs and commissions have been granted where applicable and justified. (24) The exporting producer claimed a special adjustment for differences in the level of trade pursuant to Article 2(10)(d) of the basic Regulation. The company argued that its domestic market is formed mainly by distributors and retailers while in the export market there are either OEM (i.e. original equipment manufacturers) sales or sales through distributors. In view of the absence of retailers in the export market  the exporting producer claimed an adjustment on sales prices to retailers quantified at the level of a weighted average price difference between sales prices to retailers and those to distributors in the domestic market. (25) It is noted that the exporting producer did not claim an adjustment which may arise in OEM sales. Furthermore  it has not shown that there are differences in functions of the seller for sales in the domestic market to retailers and to distributors which could affect the comparability of export price and normal value. More importantly  the investigation has shown that the vast majority of its exports to the Community concerned OEM sales  whilst such sales did not exist in the domestic market. The majority of the domestic sales were sales to distributors and only a minor proportion were sales to retailers. The request for a level of trade adjustment thus rests on the assumption that the distribution level on the domestic side is comparable to the level of OEM sales on the export side. In view of the conclusions reached in recital 27  it was decided not to pursue this matter further and consequently no adjustment was made for the alleged differences in the level of trade. 4. Dumping margin (26) Pursuant to Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation  the weighted average normal value by product type was compared with the weighted average export price by product type. (27) The calculation has shown no dumping for Moser Baer India Ltd. Given that this is the sole exporting producer in India  and pursuant to Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation  the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning CD-Rs originating in India should be terminated without the imposition of measures. D. INJURY (28) In view of the conclusions concerning dumping  it was not considered necessary to analyse injury  causality and Community interest aspects arising from the investigation since this would not alter the conclusions reached. E. CONCLUSION (29) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the termination of the anti-dumping proceeding would be based. They were granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure. Representations received further to the disclosure did not however provide any new elements which could affect the above findings. (30) In particular  CECMA claimed that there was a particular market situation and the normal value should have been constructed because the domestic sales did not permit a proper comparison since the sole exporting producer operates an Export Oriented Unit which received countervailable subsidies. CECMA also claimed that the ""strategy"" of the exporting producer to sell only low quality CD-Rs in its domestic market must be regarded as a particular market situation. (31) As set out in recitals 14 to 20 above  the investigation has shown that the domestic sales were sufficiently representative and in the ordinary course of trade. The quality of CD-Rs was taken into account when comparing domestically sold and exported product types. No particular market situation was established  which could allow the use of constructed normal value in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. The existence of any countervailable subsidies is the subject of the parallel anti-subsidy investigation and has not affected the establishment of normal value. (32) In view of the findings set out above  the Commission considers that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of CD-Rs originating in India should be terminated ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

The Commission shall deduct that amount from or add it to the monthly payment relating to the expenditure effected in the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken. (4) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005  50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Community budget if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place within 4 years of the primary administrative or judicial finding  or within 8 years if the recovery is taken to the national courts. Article 32(3) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission  together with the annual accounts  a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the application of the Member States’ reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. Annex III to the said Regulation provides the model table that had to be provided in 2010 by the Member States.

(5) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005  Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency  recorded and recognised under national law  of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within 4 years of the primary administrative or judicial finding or within 8 years if the recovery is taken to the national courts  100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the Community budget. In the summary report referred to in Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the amounts for which the Member State decided not to pursue recovery and the grounds for the decision are shown. These amounts are not charged to the Member States concerned and are consequently to be borne by the Community budget. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of the said Regulation.

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However  that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff.

Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production and may apply to quality wines psr at the request of the Member State. (2) The French Government has requested that crisis distillation be opened for table wines produced in France. (3) Production of table wine in France was 22 6 million hectolitres in 1997 and 21 1 million hectolitres in 1998. In 1999 the figure was 25 2 million hectolitres and in 2000 it was 23 02 million hectolitres. (4) Over that same period  table wine consumption in France remained relatively stable in the 1996/97 and 1997/98 wine years at around 18 3 million hectolitres  but fell in 1998/99 to 17 3 million hectolitres  which also appears to be the level of consumption for 1999/2000. By contrast  exports rose slightly between 1997 and 1999  but only exports to other Member States. Provisional figures for 2000 point to a fall in exports. (5) Stocks of table wine were 12 853 million hectolitres in 1997 and 12 086 million hectolitres in 1998. They fell to 10 85 million hectolitres in 1999. In 2000  they rose sharply to 14 07 million hectolitres. The fluctuation in stocks obviously varies widely from one department to the next  but it is very pronounced in departments with a large stock  with increases of between 47 % and 88 %. The growth in stocks has had a negative impact on prices  which have fallen by about 10 % to 17 % over the current wine year compared with the same period in the previous year. (6) In view of this situation  crisis distillation was opened for 800000 hectolitres of wine by Commission Regulation (EC) No 25/2001 of 5 January 2001 opening crisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for table wines in France(3). It has been found that this volume is insufficient to reduce stocks of table wine to an acceptable level and rectify the difficult market situation. (7) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are still satisfied  a further crisis distillation covering a maximum of 1 5 million hectolitres of table wine should be opened. The measure should apply for a limited period with a view to maximum effectiveness. No ceiling shoud be set on the quantity that individual producers can have distilled because stocks may vary substantially from one producer to another and depend more on sales than on the individual producer's annual output. (8) The mechanism to be introduced is that provided for by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2001(5). In addition to the Articles of that Regulation referring to the distillation measures provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999  other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 apply  in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of an advance. (9) The price to be paid by distillers to producers should be set at a level that permits the solution of the problems faced by allowing producers to take advantage of this measure. That price should not  however  be such that it adversely affects the application of the distillation measure provided for by Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. (10) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol  which is supplied largely by distillation under Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.

(12) Owing to the market situation  in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports  the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A1  A2 and A3 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards export refunds on fruit and vegetables should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question.

Parties therefore agreed to proceed with the adaptation of tariff concessions within the framework of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products (1) (hereinafter called the Agreement)  which entered into force on 1 June 2002. The adaptation of these concessions  which are listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement  include notably the opening of a Community tariff quota for the import of live bovine animals of a weight exceeding 160 kg. (2) It has been agreed with the Swiss Confederation that there should be no trade discontinuity. The procedures for adopting bilaterally a decision to amend Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement will not be completed immediately. In order to ensure that quota benefit is available until the entry into force of the said decision and for reasons of simplification  it is appropriate to open this tariff-quota concession on an autonomous and transitional basis. (3) Detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation and  in particular  the provisions required for quota management should be adopted in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (2).

(2) A Community inspection to Peru has shown serious deficiencies with regard to hygiene in bivalve mollusc production areas  and has demonstrated that there are insufficient guarantees about the efficiency of the controls carried out by the competent authorities. Nevertheless  the Community inspection team has identified that the controls on eviscerated Pectinidae harvested from certain aquaculture areas and on the adductor muscles of non-aquaculture Pectinidae completely separated from the viscera and gonads  are sufficient to assure the safety of these products. There is a risk for public health with regard to the imports of bivalve molluscs from or originating in Peru  and it is thus appropriate to suspend them with immediate effect  with the exception of the Pectinidae products  under certain conditions. (3) Considering the seriousness of the shortcomings identified during the inspection  the provisions of this Decision must be also applied to the products which have been dispatched to the Community before the entry into force of this Decision and presented for importation into the Community after its entry into force. Furthermore  Pectinidae harvested form certain aquaculture areas and eviscerated and  the adductor muscles of non-aquaculture Pectinidae completely separated from the viscera and gonads  dispatched to the Community before the entry into force of this Decision and presented for importation into the Community after its entry into force  should be checked in order to demonstrate the absence of marine biotoxins. (4) This Decision will be reviewed in the light of the guarantees offered by the Peruvian authorities and on the basis of the results of a further Community inspection on the spot.

391,Commission Decision of 18 March 2004 suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the People's Republic of China (2004/264/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)(the basic Regulation)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2)  and in particular Article 14(4) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) The Commission  by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC(3)  imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the People's Republic of China (PRC)  falling under CN code ex 2704 00 19 (the product concerned). The amount of the anti-dumping duty is equal to the fixed amount of EUR 32.6 per tonne of dry net weight. (2) In view of the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community on 23 July 2002  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 963/2002(4)  Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1310/2002(5)  decided that anti-dumping proceedings initiated pursuant to Commission Decision No 2277/96/ECSC(6)  Decision as last amended by Decision No 435/2001/ECSC(7)  and still in force shall be continued and be governed by the provisions of the basic Regulation with effect from 24 July 2002. Likewise  any anti-dumping measures resulting from pending anti-dumping investigations shall be governed by the provisions of the basic Regulation from 24 July 2002. (3) In December 2002  the Commission initiated an interim review at the request of Eucoke-EEIG (the applicant)  lodged on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm  in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation. (4) After the applicant had withdrawn the complaint  the Commission has proposed to the Council that the interim review should be terminated. (5) However  during the investigation of the interim review concerning the period from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 (the investigation period)  information on a change of market conditions occurred after the investigation period (i.e. from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003) which might justify the suspension of the measures currently in force  in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation  was provided to the Commission. Consequently  the Commission examined whether such suspension was warranted. B. GROUNDS (6) Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation provides that  in the Community interest  anti-dumping measures may be suspended on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of such suspension  provided that the Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and these comments have been taken into account. Article 14(4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable. (7) During the interim review investigation  a number of interested parties have alleged that in the time since the investigation period  the market situation has changed dramatically. The allegations were based on a shortage of supply of the product concerned and the high level of prices charged by the traders on the Community market. (8) In view of the seriousness of these allegations  the Commission has carried out a further investigation to assess the recent evolution of volumes and prices of the product concerned for the period between 1 October 2002 and 30 September 2003. All parties concerned were given an opportunity to present their views. All interested parties cooperated with the new investigation  the users to a somewhat lesser extent. (9) With regard to the information provided by a cooperating importer and confirmed by the users  an increase ranging from 20 % to 50 % in the price of the product concerned imported from the PRC has been reported for the period examined. This price trend was also confirmed by the Community industry. The steel industry  which is not an interested party in this proceeding  also reported an increase of 76 % in prices of all types of coke. (10) Considering that the Community users do not buy the product concerned directly from the PRC but from traders which do not make an accurate distinction according to the origin of the product  the information on the volume of the product concerned was based on the findings of a specialised magazine called The Coke Market Report  recognised as a reliable source of information for the coke market. This publication reported a decrease of imports from PRC from 15 5 million tonnes for all types of coke in 2002 to 12 million tonnes in 2003  i.e. a decrease of 23 %. This decrease is mainly the result of a recent change in the policy of the Chinese authorities which have decided to direct the Chinese production to the domestic market in order to meet an increasing domestic demand  by reducing the number of export licences granted to the Chinese exporters. A further decrease in imports from PRC of 6 5 million tonnes is expected for the year 2004  although this information has not yet been confirmed as the Chinese authorities have still to issue the licenses. In view of the decreasing number of export licenses issued by the Chinese authorities  a further increase of 19 % in the price of the product concerned is expected in 2004. Since the significant change in supplies of the product concerned is the result of a change in the policy applied by the Chinese authorities  there is no information which would allow the Commission to assume that these changes are of a lasting nature. (11) With regard to the Community industry  it is to be noted that since the imposition of the measures in 2000  the situation of the Community industry has improved. The sales and production volumes decreased slightly as did the Community consumption  but sales prices increased significantly. Investments increased by a third and employment by 10 %. Only the market share remained stable (33 %) but this was due to the emergence of new exporting countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland  while the Chinese market share decreased by more than 10 percentage points and represented 9 % of the Community market in the investigation period. The profit situation also improved  although it has not yet achieved the 10 5 % profit targeted by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC. The Community industry has  however  gained 17 percentage points since the year 2000 and became profitable during the investigation period. Furthermore  as to the situation after the investigation period (i.e. from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003)  it is worth noting that  although the Community producers have reported an increase in production and sales on the Community market of 20 % and 40 % respectively  bearing in mind that the Community producers only produce one third of the Community market demand for the product concerned  the imports from the PRC remain vital to supply the Community market. C. CONCLUSION (12) In conclusion  given the temporary change in market conditions  and in particular the high level of prices of the product concerned practised on the Community market  which is far above the injurious level found in the original investigation  together with the alleged shortage of supply of the product concerned  it is considered that the injury linked to the imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC is unlikely to resume as a result of the suspension which would be in the interest of the Community. It is therefore proposed to suspend the measures in force for a period of nine months in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. (13) Pursuant to Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation  the Commission has informed the Community industry of its intention to suspend the anti-dumping measures in force. The Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment. The Community industry did not oppose the suspension of the anti-dumping measures in force. (14) The Commission therefore considers that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed on the product concerned are met  in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. Consequently  the anti-dumping duty imposed by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC should be suspended for a period of nine months.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation  exported in the natural state  are being fixed  account must be taken of: - the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade  - marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community  as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination  - the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market  - the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty  and - the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market  and - the economic aspect of the proposed exports. (3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation  and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of: (a) prices ruling on third country markets; (b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports; (c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries  account being taken  where appropriate  of subsidies granted by those countries; and (d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices. (4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination. (5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may  however  remain at the same level for more than four weeks. (6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1472/2002(4)  the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5)  as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(6)  however  this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.

394,19.12.2012 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 349/66 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION of 17 December 2012 on a third Union financial contribution pursuant to Council Directive 2000/29/EC for 2006 and 2007 to cover expenditure incurred by Portugal for the purpose of combating Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (pinewood nematode) (notified under document C(2012) 9356) (Only the Portuguese text is authentic) (2012/796/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1)  and in particular Article 23(6) thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Decision 2006/923/EC (2) approved a financial contribution from the Union for a programme of measures introduced by Portugal aiming in 2006 and 2007 at controlling the spread of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (pinewood nematode) to other Member States. The measures included the creation of a barrier free from all host trees of the pinewood nematode vector  hereinafter the ‘clear cut belt’. (2) The financial contribution granted by Decision 2006/923/EC was based on the programme for further actions for pinewood nematode (hereinafter: PWN) and the budget estimation referring to this programme as submitted by Portugal to the Commission on 28 July 2006. (3) The final payments to Portugal connected to the actions laid down in Decision 2006/923/EC occurred in June 2008. (4) By Commission Implementing Decision 2011/851/EU (3)  an additional Union co-financing of EUR 3 986 138 36 was granted to Portugal to cover eligible expenditure in excess to the initial estimate of July 2006. (5) At the time of that additional Union co-financing  the claim submitted by Portugal did not include all the bills related to the creation of the clear cut belt. (6) By letter of 5 December 2011  the Portuguese authorities introduced a revised claim of EUR 15 000 932 08. That claim included EUR 4 915 405 87 that had not been paid at the time of the previous audit of July 2010 (audit SANCO/10/2010) and could not be declared eligible for co-financing at that time. The rest of that new claim is composed of costs for felling an increased number of large coniferous trees and of a separate expenditure for the elimination of small coniferous trees. (7) In March 2012  the Commission carried out an audit on the information communicated by Portugal on 5 December 2011. After examination of all supporting documents for the additional claim  and based on the report of that audit  the Commission concluded that an eligible amount of only EUR 5 044 839 72 of paid invoices (including coordination costs) could be taken into consideration. The rest of the claimed expenditure has not been found eligible for co-financing because it concerns expenditure already co-financed by Implementing Decision 2011/851/EU (EUR 2 024 128 16) and expenditure of EUR 7 931 964 20 related to small trees  the necessity of which has not been sufficiently justified by Portugal. (8) As the measures included in that additional claim are of the same nature  and target the same purpose as the measures of Decision 2006/923/EC  it is appropriate to allocate the same Union financial contribution rate as in that decision  namely a rate of 75 %. (9) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4)  plant-health measures are financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For the purpose of financial control of these measures  Articles 9  36 and 37 of the above Regulation should apply. (10) In accordance with Article 75 of Council Regulation (EC  Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (5) and Article 90(1) of Commission Regulation (EC  Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC  Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (6)  the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated  setting out the essential elements of the action involving the expenditure. (11) The present decision constitutes a financing decision for the expenditure provided in the co-financing request presented by Portugal.

In that case a contract is awarded to any tenderer whose bid is equal to or lower than the maximum refund.

(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation  and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of: (a) prices ruling on third country markets; (b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports; (c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries  account being taken  where appropriate  of subsidies granted by those countries; and (d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.

449,COMMISSION DECISION of 12 December 1994 accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of urea ammonium nitrate solution originating in Bulgaria and Poland (94/825/EC) THE COMMISSION OF  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 522/94 (2)  and in  particular Article 10 thereof  After consultation within the Advisory Committee  Whereas: (1) The Commission  by Regulation (EC) 1506/94 (3) (hereinafter referred to as the 'provisional duty Regulation')  imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of urea-ammonium-nitrate solution ('UAN') originating in Bulgaria  and Poland  and falling under CN code 3102 80 00. By Regulation (EC) No 2620/94 (4)  the Council extended the validity of this duty for a period not exceeding two months. (2) In the subsequent procedure it was established that definitive anti-dumping measures should be taken in order to eliminate injurious dumping. The findings and conclusions on all aspects of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC)  3319/94 (5). (3) Having been informed of those conclusions  the Bulgarian producer and exporter offered an undertaking with regard to the import prices to independent customers in the Community pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. According to this  undertaking  import prices will be at a non-injurious level as established in the framework of the present anti-dumping proceeding. (4) In addition  since the Bulgarian producer and eaxporter have undertaken to submit detailed and regular sales information to the Commission and not to enter into direct or indirect compensatory arrangements with their customers  it has been concluded  that the correct observance of the undertaking can be effectively monitored by the Commission. (5) In view of the provisions of Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  the undertaking should enter into force on the same date as the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) 3319/94 in the present proceeding. (6) In those circumstances  the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the investigation can  therefore  be terminated with respect to the Bulgarian producer and exporter concerned. (7) The producer and exporter concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the definitive anti-dumping measures were proposed and have had the opportunity to comment on all aspects of the investigation.  Accordingly should the undertaking be withdrawn or should the Commission have reason to believe that the undertaking has been violated  it may  where the interests of the Community so require  apply provisional anti-dumping duties forthwith under Article 10 (6) of Regulation (EEC) 2423/88 and  subsequently definitive anti-dumping duties could be imposed by the Council. (8) When the Advisory Committee was consulted on the acceptance of the undertakings offered  several Member States raised objections. Therefore  in accordance with Article 9 and 10 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  the Commission sent a report to the  Council on the results of the consultations and a proposal that the investigation be terminated by the acceptance of undertakings. Consequently  in accordance with the said Articles 9 and 10 (1) this Decision will only take effect and be published if  the Council does not decide otherwise within one month ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature  the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed  based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned. (4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available  on the one hand  and  on the other hand  prices on the international market. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Tomatoes  oranges  lemons  table grapes and apples of classes Extra  I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities. (8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community exports  it is appropriate to proceed by an open invitation to tender and to set the indicative refund amount and the scheduled quantities for the period concerned.

(2) The Union’s external trade statistics are not available within the periods established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1917/2000 (4). (3) Although the situation has changed since the introduction of surveillance in 2002  developments in the world steel market continue to require a reliable and quick information system on the future imports of the Union. (4) The trends of imports of the products currently under surveillance as well as stainless steel flat products and large welded tubes  currently not under the surveillance system  were examined. It was deemed necessary to examine trends for these additional products given the fact that they represent the most value-added products on the market. (5) In the last years  imports into the EU of those steel products increased substantially (by 40 %) in absolute terms between 2005 and 2008. Even if imports started to decrease since the end of 2008  imports merely followed the drop in demand and  in terms relative to consumption  they remained significant. (6) Worldwide steel production capacities have grown in 2006-2008 and are expected to continue to grow until 2010. Two-digit capacity growth in the next 2 years is expected in a variety of regions especially in China  India  Brazil and the Middle East. China  the most important country in terms of increasing capacity  represents today about 40 % of the world crude steel making capacity and about three times the EU’s yearly consumption of steel. (7) Given the fact that the EU is an important market for steel in terms of size and price  especially in the context of a strong currency  it is likely that once the market recovers and the demand on the Union market improves  any excess in steel capacity would be re-directed to the EU. In comparison  access to third country markets has been reduced to a various extent recently as countries in several geographical areas (such as Americas  Asia  Middle East) have taken measures to protect or support their steel industry. These measures took different forms  including tariff increases  licensing requirement  buy local requirements  and concern markets with a significant share of the global consumption. (8) The production of crude steel and stainless steel flat products in the EU reached the highest level in 2007 and 2006 respectively  and then started decreasing in 2008. During the first semester 2009 there was a contraction of 43 2 % compared to the first semester of 2008 as opposed to a contraction in world steel output of 22 4 % during the same period. The crisis has had an impact on all the largest steel producing countries of the EU  and as a reaction steel producers have reduced the number of days of production  thus increasing the idle capacity. (9) All producers have significantly reduced employment. In June 2009 around 40 % of the work force in the EU steel sector was affected by the economic crises in the form of permanent or temporary lay-offs and short-time working. (10) On the basis of recent trends in imports of steel products  of the current vulnerable situation of the EU industry  the continuing weak demand on the EU market and of the likelihood that current and future excess capacity would be re-directed to EU if demand would recover  a threat of injury to Union producers pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 can therefore be deemed to exist. (11) Thus  the Union interest requires that imports of certain steel products should continue to be subject to prior surveillance in order to provide advanced statistical information permitting rapid analysis of import trends. Rapid and anticipated trade data is necessary to deal with the vulnerability of the European steel market to sudden changes on world steel markets. This is particularly important in the present crisis situation marked by uncertainties as to whether the demand will structurally pick up and whether the EU industry will actually benefit from it. (12) Furthermore  in view of the developments on the market of flat stainless steel products and large welded tubes and the situation of the industries at stake  and given that similar steel import monitoring systems include these products  it is appropriate that the scope of this system includes the products listed in Annex I. (13) Taking into account the developments mentioned above  and taking into consideration that other major steel producing countries such as Canada and the United States of America have recently decided to extend their similar steel import monitoring systems (extended until 31 August 2011 and 21 March 2013  respectively)  it is appropriate that this system should continue until 31 December 2012. (14) In order to minimise unnecessary constraints and not disturb excessively the activities of companies close to the borders  the net weight of imports that are excluded from the application of this Regulation remains at 2 500 kilograms ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) There is interest in the multiplication  in the Republic of Chile  of plants of Fragaria L.  intended for planting  other than seeds  from plants supplied by a Member State  in order to prolong the producing season of the plants. The plants produced are afterwards exported to the Community to be planted for fruit production. (3) For the 2001 season  by Commission Decision 2000/700/EC(3)  derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of plants of Fragaria L.  intended for planting  other than seeds  originating in the Republic of Chile have been authorised subject to specific conditions. (4) The circumstances justifying those derogations are still valid. There is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions. (5) A derogation should therefore be authorised for a limited period  subject to specific conditions. (6) The authorisation pursuant to this Decision shall be terminated if it is established that the specific conditions laid down in the Annex thereof are not sufficient to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms or have not been complied with.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products  export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 162  163  164  167  169 and 170 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that export refunds may vary according to destination  especially where the world market situation  the specific requirements of certain markets or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.

Due to a changed market situation in the Dominican Republic  characterised by increased competition for milk powder  the quota is no longer fully used. In order to maximise the use of the quota  the differentiation of export refunds for the Dominican Republic should be abolished.

(2) The animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions for import of wild and farmed game meat and rabbit meat from third countries are laid down by Decision 2000/585/EC(9)  as last amended by Decision 2002/646/EC. (3) An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Botswana in the approved EC zone number 6 on 7 January 2003  with the initial infection on the holding detected on 23 December 2002  and the competent veterinary authority of Botswana immediately suspended exports of de-boned fresh meat of bovine  ovine and caprine species and farmed and wild ungulates to the Community from the whole of the country. (4) The Botswanan authorities are carrying out emergency vaccination and investigations on the outbreak in order to assess the situation in the country. However  while the outcome of this assessment is not available it is not possible to regionalise Botswana to allow importation of de-boned fresh meat of bovine  ovine and caprine species and farmed and wild ungulates. (5) In this situation  the importation of fresh meat from Botswana may constitute a risk of introducing foot-and-mouth disease in the territory of the Community. In consequence importation of de-boned fresh meat of bovine  ovine and caprine species and farmed and wild ungulates should be temporarily suspended from the previously approved zones of Botswana. (6) However  the Botswanan authorities have provided detailed information on en route consignments of fresh meat sent to the Community  with guarantees that those consignments were produced before the date of infection. Therefore  these consignments and consignments obtained from animals slaughtered before the date of infection should be authorised for importation into the territory of the European Union. (7) The provisions of this Decision shall be reviewed within three months in particular in the light of the disease evolution and further information received from the authorities of Botswana. (8) Decisions 1999/283/EC and 2000/585/EC must be amended accordingly.

475,COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 729/92  of 16 March 1992  imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain thermal paper originating in Japan and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty THE COUNCIL OF THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  and in particular Article 12 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission submitted after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation  Whereas: A. Provisional measures (1) The Commission by Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91 (2)  imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain thermal paper originating in Japan and falling within CN codes ex 3703 90 90 (Taric code: 3703 90 90 * 10) and ex  4810 11 90 (Taric code: 4810 11 90 * 10). Council Regulation (EEC) No 103/92 (3) extended the duty for a period not exceeding two months. B. Subsequent procedure (2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty  the interested parties who so requested were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. They also made written submissions making known their views on the findings. (3) Parties were informed in writing of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of a provisional duty. They  were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure. (4) The oral and written comments submitted by the parties were considered and where appropriate  the Commission findings were modified to take account of them. C. Product (5) In view of observations made by the Customs administrations of certain Member States concerning problems at import clearance  the Commission re-examined the product description given in recital 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91. It was found that the  expression 'thermal paper. . . destined to be used in machines . . . which print facsimiles . . .' was inadequate and should be replaced by the term 'telefax paper'. The Council supports the Commission's view. (6) One Japanese producer reiterated the points it made prior to the imposition of provisional duties  namely that telefax paper presented in jumbo reels or coils constitutes two separate products and that its exports of coils were not causing injury to  the Community industry. The Council  however  supports the Commission's view that telefax paper in the form of jumbo reels and coils constitutes one single category of product and it confirms the conclusions of recitals 10 to 12 of Regulation (EEC) No  2805/91. (7) During the Commission's investigation  it was found that  apart from the CN codes indicated in the notice of initiation of the proceeding (4)  several other codes were also being used for imports into the Community of the product concerned. Accordingly  the Commission services published a notice (5) advising the parties known to be concerned of the inclusion of these other CN codes in the proceeding. There was no reaction from interested parties to this notice. As a result also of the discussions held subsequent to the initiation of this proceeding at the level of the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC) concerning the correct classification of telefax paper  the Council of the European Communities confirms the  Commission's view that measures should also apply to all CN codes under which the product under consideration can  within the framework of existing customs legislation  be imported. The Commission has therefore concluded that the information that it possesses and has verified constitutes a valid basis for the establishment of dumping margins  the assessment of injury and the calculation of appropriate duties for the product falling  under all the CN codes concerned. D. Dumping (8) In the light of its own overall net profit  one Japanese company claimed that the reasonable profit of 18 % on cost of production used for constructing normal value was too high. The profit margin for this company's profitable sales  calculated in  accordance with Article 2 (B) (3) (b) (ii) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  was indeed found to be less than the 18 % margin used. Accordingly  the percentage of profit used for constructing normal value for this company has  where necessary  been  reduced. For the remaining companies  the Council considers that  in view of their profitability during the investigation period  18 % is a reasonable profit margin for constructing normal value and confirms the conclusions set out in recitals 13 to 23 of  Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91. No further information was received  and the Council therefore confirms that the definitive weighted average dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the cif value for each of the companies concerned are as follows: - Jujo Paper Co.  Ltd  Tokyo: 0 0 %  - Kanzaki Paper Manufacturing Co.  Ltd  Tokyo: 10 3 %  - Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd  Tokyo: 15 5 %  - Tomoegawa Paper Co.  Ltd  Tokyo: 24 8 %. The Council confirms the Commission's findings with regard to the 55 3 % dumping margin calculated for the purposes of the residual duty. E. Injury and cause of injury (9) No new elements concerning injury were submitted to the Commission following the publication of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91. The Council therefore confirms the conclusions set out in recital 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91. (10) As far as cause of injury is concerned  one Japanese producer claimed that the impact of its sales to the Community should be examined in isolation and deemed not to have caused injury  as the volume of its exports was small. (11) The Commission  in accordance with the findings of the Court of Justice  considers that the Community authorities should examine the impact on the Community industry of all dumped imports taken together  even if the export volume of an individual  company is relatively low. The Council therefore confirms the Commission's view that  for the purpose of determining injury  the exports of this company should not be treated separately from those of the other Japanese companies. F. Community interest (12) No new arguments concerning Community interest were brought forward  and the Council therefore confirms the Commission findings set out in Section F of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91 and considers that it is in the Community's interest to impose  anti-dumping measures to eliminate the injurious effects of dumped imports originating in Japan. G. Duty (13) With regard to the calculation to determine the duty rate necessary to eliminate the injury being suffered by Community industry  the Commission considers that the difference between the actual selling price in the Community of the Japanese product  and a sales price which enables Community industry to achieve an 18 % profit on turnover  should be removed. (14) For the reasons given in recital 46 of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91  an 18 % profit margin is the minimum necessary to render possible additional investments in manufacturing facilities and research and development. Taking into account the fast  changing nature of the industry concerned and the continual need to adapt paper to suit new hardware  the Commission is of the opinion that  without this profit margin  the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry would inevitably be  exacerbated and the injury caused by dumping would remain. (15) The Council therefore confirms the Commission findings with regard to the injury threshold established in Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91; however  as the injury correction figures calculated for the cooperating companies are higher than the dumping  margins established  it is the latter which are to be the basis for applying the duty. With regard to the residual duty  the injury correction figure was less than the dumping margin and the former will therefore be taken into account. (16) On the basis of calculations of dumping and injury described in Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91 and the submissions subsequently received  the Council therefore concludes that duties should be imposed to eliminate the level of dumping found for Kanzaki  Paper Manufacturing Co.  Ltd  Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd and Tomoegawa Paper Co.  Ltd. No duty should be applied to Jujo Paper Co.  Ltd  which was found not to be dumping. (17) As far as the other companies are concerned  the Council  for the reasons given in recital 49 of Regulation 2805/91  confirms that  as provided for in Article 7 (7) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  the duty to be imposed on these companies  should be based on the facts available. (18) The Commission has noted a continuing decline in import prices and therefore considers anti-dumping duty in ad-valorem form to be inappropriate to remedy the injury caused to the Community industry. The Council agrees and concludes that a specific  duty  calculated and applied on a weight basis  would be more appropriate. (19) Accordingly  the amount of anti-dumping duty for the product under consideration shall be ECU 1 275 15 per tonne (net weight)  except when manufactured by the following companies  for whom the amount of anti-dumping duty is set out below: - Kanzaki Paper Manufacturing Co.  Ltd: ECU 211 55 per tonne (net weight)  - Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd: ECU 395 00 per tonne (net weight)  - Tomoegawa Paper Co.  Ltd: ECU 563 75 per tonne (net weight). No anti-dumping duties should apply to goods manufactured by Jujo Paper Co.  Ltd. H. Undertaking (20) One Japanese producer  Tomoegawa Paper Co. Ltd has offered an undertaking which is considered acceptable. The undertaking will increase the price of the products in question to a level sufficient to eliminate the dumping established by the  Commission. Following consultations with the Member States  the undertaking was accepted by Commission Decision 92/177/EEC (6). I. Collection of the provisional duties (21) In view of the size of the dumping margins established and of the serious nature of the injury caused to the Community industry  the Council considers it necessary that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty for all  companies should be collected definitively to the extent of the amount of the definitive duty imposed ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(3) If information on sugar of the standard quality is to be comparable  the price increases or reductions fixed pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 784/68 must be added to or deducted from the offers taken into consideration in the case of white sugar. In the case of raw sugar  the corrective factors provided for in Article 5(1)(b) must be applied. (4) The representative price is modified only if the variation in the elements used to calculate it would entail an increase or a reduction of not less than 1 20 EUR/100 kilograms in relation to the representative price previously fixed. (5) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1423/95.

That coefficient expresses the ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirituous beverage concerned on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirituous beverage in question. In view of the information provided by the United Kingdom on the period 1 January to 31 December 1999  the average ageing period in 1999 was seven years for Scotch whisky. The coefficients for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 September 2001 should be fixed.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content.

(5) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001.

Due to a changed market situation in the Dominican Republic  characterised by increased competition for milk powder  the quota is no longer fully used.

512,"Council Regulation (EC) No 2448/2000 of 7 November 2000 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular Article 26 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas: (1) Community supplies of certain fishery products currently depend on imports from third countries. It is in the Community's interest to suspend in part or in whole the customs duties for the products in question  within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume. In order not to jeopardise the development prospects of this production in the Community and to ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries  it is advisable to open those quotas  applying customs duties varied accordingly to sensitivity of the different products on the Community market. (2) It is necessary  in particular  to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up. (3) The decision for the opening of autonomous tariff quotas should be taken by the Community. To ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas  there is no reasonable obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. However  this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly. (4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(1)  has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations. (5) Examination of the situation as regards supplies of tropical shrimps and prawns from South and Central America (shrimp and prawns of the genus Penaeus  except the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus japonicus) to the Community market has shown that  mainly due to the ""white spot syndrome"" affecting the species  the user industries are temporarily no longer receiving sufficient supplies.

(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1163/2002(4)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1324/2002(5).

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2).

525,"Commission Decision of 3 August 2001 laying down provisional measures for imports into Portugal and Finland of special raw cane sugar for refining at the start of the 2001/02 marketing year (notified under document number C(2001) 2479) (Only the Finnish  Portuguese and Swedish texts are authentic) (2001/656/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1)  and in particular Article 39(6) thereof  Whereas: (1) With a view to supplying Community refineries  Article 39(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides for imports of raw cane sugar at a reduced rate of duty in accordance with the agreements concluded with certain supplier countries and subject to the conditions laid down therein. These sugars are called ""special preferential sugar"". (2) The quantities imported under these conditions are intended to cover the Member States' presumed maximum supply needs  as fixed in Article 39(2)  that cannot be met by alternative supplies of raw sugar for refining. (3) A forecast supply balance for the 2001/02 marketing year indicates such a need that is not covered. This supply shortfall is being felt notably in the Member States listed in the said Article 39(2) and in which sugar refinery activity depends to a great extent on imports of these special preferential sugars. In view of the staggered production of other available sugars and the fixing of contracts relating thereto  an alternative source of supply is not feasible. In the absence of an agreement with the ACP countries  a break in supply to these Member States is thus inevitable. (4) The agreements on imports of special preferential cane sugar  applicable in the 1995/96 to 2000/01 marketing years  expired on 30 June 2001. Negotiation of the agreements to cover the period referred to in Article 38(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 has not yet begun. In order to avoid a break in supply to refineries in certain Community regions  in accordance with the Council invitation and having consulted the supplier countries concerned  imports of cane sugar should be authorised under the conditions applying until 30 June 2001 in those Community regions where a supply need has been noted in the forecast supply balance. This measure should cover the supply needs of Portugal and Finland for three months. So as not to prejudice the negotiations mentioned above  provision should currently be made only for sugar of ACP origin. (5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 407/2001 of 28 February 2001 opening a preferential tariff quota in respect of imports of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States for supply to refineries in the period 1 March to 30 June 2001(2) should apply for the purposes of fixing the import duty and the minimum purchase price. (6) The rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1916/95 of 2 August 1995 laying down detailed rules for application for the importation under preferential agreements on tariff quotas of raw cane sugar for refining(3) should apply to the tariff quota opened by this Decision. (7) This measure adopted by this Decision applies irrespective of any decisions taken subsequently by the Council as regards the agreements covering the period 2001-06  including any adjustments applicable from 1 July 2001.

534,31.7.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 202/37 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 749/2008 of 30 July 2008 amending several regulations concerning import tariff quotas in the beef and veal sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1)  and in particular Article 144(1) in conjunction with Article 4 thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 11(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (2) provides certain rules as regards notifications of the Member States to the Commission. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations which might be laid down by the sectoral regulations. It is appropriate to provide  in Commission Regulations specific to certain quotas in the beef and veal sector  for more detailed rules on notifications concerning import licences in that sector. In particular  in order to clarify the obligations related to the closing date for notifications relating to quantities covered by import licences  such obligations should be laid down for each import tariff quota concerned and it is therefore necessary to derogate from the second subparagraph of Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 on that point. The following Regulations should be amended accordingly: — Commission Regulation (EC) No 297/2003 of 17 February 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of the tariff quota for beef and veal originating in Chile (3)  — Commission Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 of 8 December 2004 laying down detailed rules of application for an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef originating in Switzerland (4)  — Commission Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 of 23 December 2005 laying down detailed rules for the application of an import tariff quota for live bovine animals of a weight exceeding 160 kg and originating in Switzerland provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products (5)  — Commission Regulation (EC) No 529/2007 of 11 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206 29 91 (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008) (6)  — Commission Regulation (EC) No 545/2007 of 16 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen beef intended for processing (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008) (7)  — Commission Regulation (EC) No 558/2007 of 23 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for young male bovine animals for fattening (8)  and — Commission Regulation (EC) No 659/2007 of 14 June 2007 opening and providing for the administration of import tariff quotas for bulls  cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds (9). (2) The import tariff quota opened by Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 is managed on the basis of documents issued by the third country concerned. Therefore  it is necessary to clarify that the provisions of Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004  without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in that Regulation.

(2) According to the information received by the Commission  catches of the stock referred to in the Annex to this Regulation by vessels flying the flag of or registered in the Member State referred to therein have exhausted the quota allocated for 2011.

537,COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1490/96 of 23 July 1996 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester staple fibre originating in Belarus and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  and in particular Article 23 thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (2)  and in particular Article 12 thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) By Regulation (EC) No 394/96 (3) (hereinafter 'the provisional duty Regulation`)  the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of polyester staple fibre (hereinafter 'PSF` or 'product concerned`) originating in Belarus  falling within CN code 5503 2000. (2) By Regulation (EC) No 1050/96 (4) the Council extended the validity of this duty for a period of two months. B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE (3) The provisional duty Regulation set up a time limit within which the parties concerned could make known their views in writing and apply to be heard orally by the Commission. (4) Only the sole Belarussian exporter concerned requested  within that time limit  and was granted a hearing. (5) 'Eurofibrefill`  an association formed by a group of users of PSF  made known its views in writing nearly three months following the entry into force of the provisional duty Regulation  and hence after the abovementioned time limit. In any event  no arguments different from those previously made by Eurofibrefill in the course of the investigation  and covered by the provisional duty Regulation  were contained in the new submission. C. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT  DUMPING  COMMUNITY INDUSTRY  INJURY  CAUSATION OF INJURY AND COMMUNITY INTEREST (6) No further substantiated arguments have been made by any of the parties concerned regarding the Commission's provisional findings on the product concerned  on the like product  on dumping  Community industry  injury  causation of injury and Community interest. Consequently  these findings  as set out in recitals 10 to 78 of the provisional duty Regulation  are confirmed by the Council. D. FORM OF A DEFINITIVE MEASURE TO BE IMPOSED (7) During the hearing granted to the Belarussian exporter (see recital 4)  the latter enquired about the possibility of offering a price-undertaking  so that the investigation could be terminated without the imposition of definitive duties. However  no such offer has subsequently been made. (8) For the following reasons  a price-undertaking does not appear to be an appropriate solution in the present case: (a) minimum prices of PSF would have to be linked to the considerable price fluctuations of its main raw materials on the international markets  which would make an undertaking unworkable; (b) the product concerned is extremely hetero-geneous. An efficient monitoring of an undertaking  which should comprise all different types and combinations of PSF (factors like size  colour  cutlength  shading  etc. are all decisive for setting a selling price)  would be extremely difficult. The risk of circumvention would be considerable; (c) the low level of cooperation found during the investigation  as demonstrated by the fact that the exporter concerned submitted evidence for only 2 % of the total quantity of PSF imported into the Community from Belarus  would increase this risk even more. (9) In these circumstances it is considered that the most suitable form of any definitive measure to be imposed in the present proceeding would therefore be an ad valorem duty. The Council confirms this approach. E. DEFINITIVE DUTY (10) In order to establish the level of the definitive duty  the Commission took account of the dumping margin found and of the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury sustained by the Community industry  in accordance with the methodology described in recitals 79 to 81 of the provisional duty Regulation. (11) Since the increase in export prices necessary to remove the injury suffered by the Community industry is greater than the dumping margin found  the definitive duty to be imposed should correspond to the dumping margin established  i.e. 43 5 %. The Council confirms this level of the definitive duty. F. COLLECTION OF THE PROVISIONAL DUTY (12) In view of the dumping margin established and the substantial injury caused to the Community industry  it is considered that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty should be definitively collected ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Article 23(3) and (4) clearly state that the headings concerned are reserved exclusively for preferential imports from Switzerland under the special arrangements that the Community has concluded with that country. Given that IMA 1 certificates are no longer used when those products are imported  Article 3(b) no longer makes any sense. In the interests of clarity  Article 3 should therefore be updated. (2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98 permits operators to submit a licence application for each CN code under the ""minimum access"" quotas referred to in Annex II. This has resulted in excessive numbers of applications  leading to a heavy workload for the competent departments of the Member States and the Commission and financial costs to operators. The provisions concerned should be amended to restrict operators to just one application per serial number. (3) Article 21 of Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98  which lays down the detailed rules for the application of the non-quota preferential import arrangements  lists the products covered by those arrangements. CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06  which are covered  inter alia  by Council Decision 69/352/EEC of 6 October 1969 concluding a tariff agreement with Switzerland concerning certain cheeses listed in position ex 4.04 of the Common Customs Tariff(5) and listed in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98  are not listed in Article 21. An addition should therefore be made to Article 21 and it should be stipulated that ""BergkĂ¤se"" cheese falling within CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06 is not covered by the said tariff agreement.

Those exceptional measures go beyond the concessions granted to those countries in the form of reduced duties laid down in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1374/98.

541,10.7.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 180/8 COMMISSION DECISION of 25 June 2007 on the compatibility with Community law of measures taken by Germany pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law  regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (2007/476/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law  regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (1) and in particular Article 3a(2) thereof  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of Directive 89/552/EEC  Whereas: (1) By letter of 28 April 1999  Germany notified to the Commission measures to be taken pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Directive 89/552/EEC. (2) The Commission verified  within three months from this notification  that such measures are compatible with Community law  in particular as regards the proportionality of the measures and the transparency of the national consultation procedure. (3) In its examination  the Commission took into consideration the available data on the German media landscape. (4) The list of events of major importance for society included in the German measures was drawn up in a clear and transparent manner. (5) The Commission was satisfied that the events listed in the German measures met at least two of the following criteria considered to be reliable indicators of the importance of events for society: (i) a special general resonance within the Member State  and not simply a significance to those who ordinarily follow the sport or activity concerned; (ii) a generally recognised  distinct cultural importance for the population in the Member State  in particular as a catalyst of cultural identity; (iii) involvement of the national team in the event concerned in the context of a competition or tournament of international importance; and (iv) the fact that the event has traditionally been broadcast on free television and has commanded large television audiences. (6) A significant number of the events listed in the German measures  including the summer and winter Olympic games  all European Championship and World Cup football matches involving the German national team  as well as the opening match  the semi-finals and the finals of these tournaments  fall within the category of events traditionally considered to be of major importance for society  as referred to explicitly in recital 18 of Directive 97/36/EC. These events have a special general resonance in Germany  as they are particularly popular with the general public  not just with those who usually follow sport events. (7) The particular attention given  even in the non-specialised press  to the remaining events listed  including the semi-finals and final of the German FA Cup  the German national football team’s home and away matches  and the final of any European football club competition (Champions League  UEFA Cup) involving a German club  testifies to their special general resonance in Germany. (8) The events listed have a generally recognised  distinct cultural importance for the German population  given their important contribution to understanding between peoples  as well as the importance of sport for the German society as a whole and for the national pride  as they provide the occasion for top German sportsmen to succeed in these most important international competitions. (9) The German measures appear proportionate so as to justify a derogation from the fundamental EC Treaty freedom to provide services on the basis of an overriding reason of public interest  which is to ensure wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society. (10) The German measures are compatible with EC competition rules in that the definition of qualified broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events is based on objective criteria that allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition  the number of listed events is not disproportionate so as to distort competition on the downstream free television and pay television markets. (11) After communication by the Commission to the other Member States of the German measures and consultation of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of Directive 89/552/EEC  the Director-General for Education and Culture informed Germany  by letter of 2 July 1999  that the European Commission did not intend to object to the measures notified. (12) The German measures entered into force on 1 April 2000. These final measures differed from the measures notified in 1999 insofar as one event no longer appeared among the listed events  namely the ‘Cup Winner’s Cup’  which was because the tournament had been discontinued after being held for the last time in 1998/1999. (13) Those measures were published in the C Series of the Official Journal of the European Communities  (2) in accordance with Article 3a(2) of Directive 89/552/EEC. (14) It follows from the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Case T-33/01  Infront WM v Commission  that the declaration that measures taken pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Directive 89/552/EEC are compatible with Community law constitutes a decision within the meaning of Article 249 of the EC Treaty  which must therefore be adopted by the Commission. Accordingly  it is necessary to declare by this Decision that the measures notified by Germany are compatible with Community law.

That Decision provides that susceptible wood packaging material including material in the form of boxes  composed of wood more than 6 mm of thickness  shall not be allowed to leave the demarcated area. (2) An exception from that prohibition may  however  be granted provided that the wood is treated and marked by an authorised processing plant in accordance with the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 on Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade. (3) In Portugal  certain companies produce wine boxes from wood treated in accordance with those provisions and accompanied by a plant passport. After the production process  however  no mark attesting that this treatment has been carried out is present. Such wine boxes therefore do not fall within the scope of that exception. (4) To allow such wine boxes to come under the exception it is necessary to provide that the companies producing those boxes may be authorised to mark them  provided that they are supervised to ensure that the applicable provisions are complied with. Portugal has informed the Commission that it is willing to authorise and supervise these companies.

544,24.10.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 293/15 COMMISSION DECISION of 23 October 2006 suspending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 215/2002 on imports of ferro molybdenum originating in the People’s Republic of China (2006/714/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation)  and in particular Article 14(4) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   PROCEDURE (1) The Council  by Regulation (EC) No 215/2002 of 28 January 2002 (2)  imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro molybdenum originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC)  falling under CN code 7202 70 00 (the product concerned). The rate of the anti-dumping duty is 22 5 %. (2) Information on a change of market conditions which occurred after the original investigation period (i.e. from 1 October 1999 to 30 September 2000)  and which might justify the suspension of the measures currently in force  in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation  was provided to the Commission. Consequently  the Commission examined whether such suspension was warranted. B.   GROUNDS (3) Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation provides that  in the Community interest  anti-dumping measures may be suspended on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of such suspension  provided that the Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and these comments have been taken into account. Article 14(4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable. (4) Eurofer  on behalf of a number of users of the product concerned  has alleged that in the time since the investigation period  the market situation has changed. The complainants in the original investigation and other Community producers of the product concerned  represented by Euroalliages  commented on these allegations  and an adversarial exchange of views took place. (5) Since the definitive imposition of the measures in February 2002  Chinese imports have decreased substantially. Eurostat statistics point to a drop from ca. 12 KT in 2001 to virtually no imports in the period 1 April 2005-31 March 2006. Euroalliages calculated a higher degree of penetration with imports reaching over 1 KT based on the allegation that certain imports declared as having a Dutch origin were in reality Chinese. In any event  even under this assumption  the very significant drop in import penetration is clear. (6) Regarding imports from other third countries  these have increased from ca. 2 7 KT to 10 7 KT  thus compensating partially the drop in Chinese imports. Consumption has increased by 14 %. (7) Market prices in the Community have increased from ca. EUR 8/kg in the original IP to ca. EUR 80/kg in 2005 and are in the range of ca. EUR 60/kg in 2006. These trends can also be found in other major markets across the world. (8) Out of the factors claimed by the parties the main explanation for this price increase seems to be a shortage in roasting capacities  i.e.  the capacities to transform molybdenum concentrate into molybdenum oxide (which is then converted into ferro molybdenum). This driving factor explains to a large extent the price increases and the demand-supply imbalance that this has generated in the Community market. On the basis of the information presented  it appears that the roasting capacity shortfall will disappear in all likelihood in the course of 2007 as a result of new roasting capacity coming on stream. (9) With regard to the Community industry  it is to be noted that since the imposition of the measures  the situation of the Community industry has improved. The sales and production volumes have increased by 25 % and 5 % respectively  reaching a market share of ca. 26 %. The profit situation also improved. Although the Community industry has not consistently achieved the normal 5 % profit level established by the original investigation  the Community industry has  however  gained up to 5 percentage points and become profitable. (10) Chinese export prices to third countries have followed the same upward trend described above indicating that should measures be suspended it is unlikely that they would decrease in the very short term to such an extent that injury would resume. (11) No indications have been found as to why the suspension would not be in the Community interest. C.   CONCLUSION (12) In conclusion  given the temporary change in market conditions  and in particular the high level of prices of the product concerned practised on the Community market  which is far above the injurious level found in the original investigation  together with the alleged demand-supply imbalance of the product concerned  it is considered that the injury linked to the imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC is unlikely to resume as a result of the suspension. It is therefore proposed to suspend for nine months the measures in force in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. (13) Pursuant to Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation  the Commission has informed the Community industry of its intention to suspend the anti-dumping measures in force. The Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment. The Community industry did not oppose the suspension of the anti-dumping measures in force. (14) The Commission therefore considers that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed on the product concerned are met  in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. Consequently  the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 215/2002 should be suspended for a period of nine months. (15) The Commission will monitor the development of imports and the prices of the product concerned. Should a situation arise at any time in which increased volumes at dumped prices of the product concerned from the PRC resume and consequently cause injury to the Community industry  the Commission will reinstate the anti-dumping duty by repealing the present suspension ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

549,COMMISSION DECISION  of 11 December 1991  approving the grant of aid by Portugal to the coal industry in 1991  (Only the Portuguese text is authentic)  (92/54/ECSC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community  Having regard to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of 30 June 1986 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry (1)  Whereas: I By letter of 10 September 1991 the Portuguese Government informed the Commission  in accordance with Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC  of the financial measure it intends to take to support the coal industry in 1991. Aid to cover operating losses in 1991 of the undertaking Carbonifera do Douro totalling Esc 803 777 000 for the production of about 0 221 million tonnes has been submitted by the Portuguese Government for approval by the Commission. II The decrease in aid compared with 1990 must be viewed in the light of the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC  in particular those of Article 2 (1) thereof  and of the implementation of the business strategy of the undertaking Carbonifera do Douro   submitted to the Commission by the Portuguese Government by letter of 16 April 1991. The aim of the abovementioned business strategy is progressively to reduce the production and workforce of the undertaking Carbonifera do Douro between 1990 and 1994  when total closure of the undertaking is planned. The trend recorded in 1991 is consistent with the aim of the business strategy. Although the cost of each tonne produced increased owing to the substantial impact of labour costs on the total costs  the combined effect of the reduction in output and the  increase in coal prices resulted in a reduction in the overall amount of aid for 1991 as compared to 1990. The aid proposed will cover the difference between the projected average costs and the projected average revenue for each tonne produced. The aid will not exceed expected operating losses and hence complies with the conditions laid down in Article 3 (1)  of the Decision. The gradual closure that this measure allows will facilitate the execution of regional development programmes and hence contribute to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry  in accordance with the third  indent of Article 2 (1). In view of the foregoing and of the information supplied by the Portuguese authorities  the aid to be granted to the current production of the Portuguese coal industry in 1991 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC and with the  proper functioning of the common market. III Pursuant to Article 11 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC  the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it authorizes is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Article 3 and 6 thereof. It must therefore be informed of  the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. Whereas the fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination. (4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.

(2) Portugal has requested authorisation from the Commission to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base since it is unable to make the precise calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point (10) of Annex X  Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC. Such calculation is likely to involve an unjustified administrative burden in relation to the effect of these transactions on Portugal’s total VAT own resources base. Portugal is able to make a calculation using approximate estimates for this category of transactions. Portugal should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT own resources base using approximate estimates in accordance with the second indent of Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC  Euratom) No 1553/89.

(2) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 lays down that a maximum buying-in price is to be fixed for quality R3  where appropriate  under each partial invitation to tender in the light of tenders received while Article 13(2) of that Regulation states that a decision may be taken to make no award. In accordance with Article 36 of that Regulation  only tenders quoting prices not exceeding the maximum buying-in price and not exceeding the average national or regional market price  plus the amount referred to in Article 1(6) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 of 20 June 2001 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef(7)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1922/2001(8)  are to be accepted.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6)  on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinized starch  no export refund is to be granted.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products  export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 162  163  164  167  169 and 170 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that export refunds may vary according to destination  especially where the world market situation  the specific requirements of certain markets or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary. (4) Export refunds for the Dominican Republic have been differentiated to take into account the reduced custom duties applied on imports under the import tariff quota under the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Dominican Republic on import protection for milk powder in the Dominican Republic (2)  approved by Council Decision 98/486/EC (3). Due to a changed market situation in the Dominican Republic  characterised by increased competition for milk powder  the quota is no longer fully used. In order to maximise the use of the quota  the differentiation of export refunds for the Dominican Republic should be abolished.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial. (8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products""  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ""other cereals""  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) However  in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets  allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported. (6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

(2) Under that Regulation it is possible  in certain circumstances  to use other allocation methods  to divide quotas into tranches  or to reserve a proportion of a specific quantitative limit exclusively for applications which are supported by evidence of the results of past import performance. (3) Rules for management of the quotas established for 2007 should be adopted before the quota year begins so that the continuity of trade flows is not affected unduly. (4) The measures adopted in previous years  such as those in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2038/2005 of 14 December 2005 laying down rules for the management and distribution of textile quotas established for the year 2006 under Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 (2)  proved to be satisfactory and it is therefore appropriate to adopt similar rules for 2007. (5) In order to satisfy the greatest possible number of operators it is appropriate to make the ‘first come  first served’ allocation method more flexible by placing a ceiling on the quantities which can be allocated to each operator by that method. (6) To guarantee a degree of continuity in trade and efficient quota administration  operators should be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2007 equivalent to the quantity which they imported in 2006. (7) To achieve optimum use of the quantities  an operator who has used up at least one half of the amount already authorised should be permitted to apply for a further amount  provided that quantities are available in the quotas. (8) For the sake of sound administration  import authorisations should be valid for nine months from the date of issue but only until the end of the year at the latest. Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify  in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary  that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should  however  be authorised  in response to importers' applications  to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2008 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date.

596,24.3.2010 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 77/55 COMMISSION DECISION of 23 March 2010 amending Decision 2006/109/EC by accepting three offers to join the joint price undertaking accepted in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China (2010/177/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’)  and in particular Articles 8 and 11(3) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   PROCEDURE (1) The Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 (2) (the definitive Regulation)  imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This Regulation was last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 500/2009 (3). (2) The Commission  by Decision 2006/109/EC (4) accepted a joint price undertaking from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products (CCCME) together with 20 cooperating Chinese companies or cooperating groups of companies. This Decision was amended by Commission Decision 2008/437/EC (5). (3) The definitive Regulation gives the possibility to new Chinese exporting producers to be granted the same treatment as the cooperating companies in the original investigation  on the condition that these producers have been granted the new exporting producer treatment (NEPT) in accordance with Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005. (4) Following three requests for NEPT based on Article 1(4) of the definitive Regulation  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 426/2008 (6) amended the definitive Regulation and assigned an individual duty rate of 28 6 % to the exporting producers HanDan County Yan Yuan Smelting and Casting Co.  Ltd (HanDan)  XianXian Guozhuang Precision Casting Co.  Ltd (XianXian) and Wuxi Norlong Foundry Co.  Ltd (Norlong). (5) Following a request for NEPT based on Article 1(4) of the definitive Regulation  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 282/2009 (7) amended the definitive Regulation and assigned and individual duty rate of 28 6 % to the exporting producer Weifang Stable Casting Co.  Ltd (Weifang). (6) It is recalled that all four exporting producers received individual treatment (IT) during the NEPT investigation. (7) Two of the four above-mentioned exporting producers granted NEPT (XianXian and Weifang) submitted together with the CCCME formal offers to join the joint liability undertaking accepted by the Commission. (8) On 10 June 2009  the Commission  by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union  (8)  initiated a partial interim review of the definitive measures. The review is limited in scope to the examination of the form of the measures and in particular to the examination of the acceptability and workability of undertakings offered by exporting producers in the PRC. (9) After the initiation of the partial interim review of the measures  yet another exporting producer granted NEPT  HanDan  submitted within the deadline  together with the CCCME a formal offer to join the joint liability undertaking accepted by the Commission. (10) Another exporting producer granted NEPT  Norlong  submitted that it does not wish to adhere to the joint undertaking accepted by the Commission  but offered  within the deadline  a separate undertaking. (11) On 15 December 2009  the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to accept the offers to join the joint price undertaking submitted by CCCME and HanDan  by CCCME and XianXian and by CCCME and Weifang and to reject the undertaking offered by Norlong were disclosed to interested parties. They were given the opportunity to comment. Their comments have been assessed before taking a final decision. B.   UNDERTAKING OFFERS (12) With regard to the undertaking offer submitted by CCCME together with Handan  XianXian and Weifang  it is noted that they are identical to the collective undertaking offer accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC and thus the CCCME and the three exporting producers undertake to ensure that the product concerned is exported at or above a minimum import price (MIP) set at a level that eliminates the injurious effect of dumping. It is recalled that the undertaking includes the indexation of the minimum import price of the product concerned in accordance with public international quotations for its main raw material  i.e. pig iron  given that casting prices vary significantly depending on the prices of pig iron. (13) In addition  a further investigation showed that there are no company specific reasons that would call for a refusal of the offer submitted by CCCME together with HanDan  XianXian and Weifang. In view of the foregoing  and as the companies received an individual duty rate  the Commission considers that it can accept the undertaking offer made by CCCME and the exporting producers. (14) Moreover  the regular and detailed reports which the CCCME and the companies undertake to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring. It is  therefore  considered that the risk of circumventing the undertaking is limited. (15) With regard to the separate undertaking offered by Norlong  it should be recalled that the original undertaking accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC was a joint liability undertaking of 20 companies together with the CCCME. The fact that it was offered as a joint undertaking contributed in a decisive manner to its acceptability by the Commission given that it increased the practicability and improved the control of the respect of the obligations deriving from the undertaking  all of this being necessary in view of the great number of exporting producers involved. (16) Norlong argued that the Commission had already accepted in the past at least one individual undertaking from a company which had not been granted market economy treatment (MET) but only individual treatment (9)  as is the case of Norlong. However  it should be emphasized that the situation in the case referred to by Norlong is different from the situation in the original undertaking accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC: in the case referred to by Norlong  only one undertaking offer of one exporting producer was finally accepted. It should also be recalled that that undertaking was subsequently withdrawn by the Commission because of numerous breaches found  including cross-compensation schemes (10). (17) In the case of the undertaking accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC  the specificity of the situation  i.e. the great number of companies which exceeds 20  requires a particular set-up for a special control and monitoring. Norlong did not bring forward any relevant argument suggesting that it was in a different situation as the other companies part of the joint undertaking or justifying that the Commission should treat Norlong in a different way than the other companies that are part to the joint undertaking. Moreover  Norlong’s offer would imply a duplication of efforts of the Commission’s control and monitoring system. Since it would not be practicable and cost-effective for the Commission to control the respect of the obligations deriving from Norlong’s individual undertaking offer  the Commission considers that it cannot accept the separate undertaking offer made by Norlong. (18) The Union industry objected to the undertaking offer submitted by CCCME together with HanDan  XianXian and Weifang  arguing that the MIP would be too low to protect the European industry from the effect of dumped imports and that the Union industry is suffering further injury. As regards the level of the MIP  it should be noted that anti-dumping duties were imposed at the level of the dumping margins found which were lower than the injury margins. Therefore  the MIP was also set on the normal value and thus eliminates merely the dumping established  in conformity with the principle of the lesser duty rule set out in Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. (19) The Union industry further argued that  despite the imposition of anti-dumping measures  the market share of Chinese exporters increased since the original investigation period (11). The Union industry claimed that this was due to an increase in exports from China combined with a sharp drop in Union consumption. However  no conclusive evidence with regard to the alleged sharp drop in consumption was submitted. Moreover  from the statistics available (12)  it appears that dumped imports have decreased by 14 % since the original investigation period. (20) In view of the above  none of the reasons put forward by the Union industry could alter the conclusion that the undertaking offer submitted by CCCME together with HanDan  Weifang and XianXian should be accepted. (21) In order to enable the Commission to monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertaking  when the request for release into free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional upon (i) the presentation of an undertaking invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 268/2006 (13); (ii) the fact that imported goods are manufactured  shipped and invoiced directly by the said company to the first independent customer in the Union; and (iii) the fact that the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the description on the undertaking invoice. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall instead be payable. (22) To further ensure the respect of the undertaking  importers have been made aware by Regulation (EC) No 268/2006 that the non-fulfilment of the conditions provided for by that Regulation  or the withdrawal by the Commission of the acceptance of the undertaking  may lead to a customs debt being incurred for the relevant transactions. (23) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking or in case of withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission  the anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation shall automatically apply pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation. (24) In view of the above  the undertaking offered by Norlong should be rejected. The offer submitted by CCCME and HanDan  by CCCME and XianXian and by CCCME and Weifang to join the joint price undertaking as accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC should be accepted  and Article 1 of Decision 2006/109/EC should be amended accordingly ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) In order to make it easier to draw up and manage the budget for Community food aid actions and to enable the Member States to know the extent of Community participation in the financing of national food aid actions  the level of the refunds granted for these actions should be determined. (3) The general and implementing rules provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 on export refunds are applicable mutatis mutandis to the abovementioned operations. (4) The specific criteria to be used for calculating the export refund on rice are set out in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95.

In the cereals sector  one of the new concessions provided for is the abolition of export refunds for malt. (2) With a view to adopting this agreement  and in order to clarify the export terms at the beginning of April 2003 for all exporters in the cereals sector  in particular in view of the period of validity of export licences  those export refunds should be abolished from 1 April 2003. (3) The authorities of Poland have undertaken to ensure that only consignments of Community products covered by the trade agreement on which no refund has been granted are allowed for import into that country. To that end  Article 7a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2305/2002(6)  should apply to malt exports to Poland. (4) It has been found that  in periods of increase in refund rates  the security of EUR 15 per tonne laid down in Article 10(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 is not sufficient to prevent large numbers of export licences in force for cereals and cereal products being returned to the issuing authorities. As such returns may generate problems in the administration of the exports  they should be discouraged by raising that security. (5) Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Recent reductions in export refund rates  due to the combined effects of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market  have led to a situation in which less or no applications for refund certificates have been submitted  consequently easing the pressure on the Union budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Union is not in danger of breaching its international commitments  it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  therefore reducing the administrative burden. (3) It is therefore appropriate to increase the payment threshold beneath which small exporters are exempted from submitting a refund certificate at individual and at global level. It is also appropriate to suspend the obligations for the competent authorities of the Member States to notify the amounts of refund certificates applied for where the refunds applicable to all the basic products are either suspended  not fixed or equal to zero  to notify certain refund certificates issued where no refund certificates were issued and  where no amounts are involved  the obligation to notify certain information for guaranteeing the functioning and the management of the refund certificate system and to inform the Commission that no amounts have been granted. (4) Regulation (EU) No 578/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly. (5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

(2) In Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation No 1015/94  the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty camera systems listed in the Annex to that Regulation (‘the Annex’)  representing high-end professional camera systems technically falling within the product definition under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1015/94  but which cannot be regarded as television camera systems. (3) In October 1995  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 2474/95 (3)  amended Regulation (EC) No 1015/94  in particular as regards the definition of the like product and certain models of professional camera systems which were explicitly exempted from the definitive anti-dumping duty. (4) In October 1997  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1952/97 (4)  amended the rates of the definitive anti-dumping duty for two companies concerned  namely for Sony Corporation and Ikegami Tsushinki Co. Ltd pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation. Furthermore  the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty certain new models of professional camera systems by adding them to the Annex. (5) In January 1999 and January 2000  the Council  by Regulations (EC) No 193/1999 (5) and (EC) No 176/2000 (6)  amended Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex and thus excluding those from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty. In October 2004  the Council  by Regulation (EC) 1754/2004 (7)  amended Regulation (EC) No 176/2000. (6) In September 2000  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 (8)  confirmed the definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. (7) In January 2001 and in May 2001  the Council  by Regulations (EC) No 198/2001 (9) and (EC) No 951/2001 (10)  amended Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus excluding them from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty. (8) In September 2001  further to an interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1900/2001 (11) confirmed the level of the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 on imports of TCS from the exporting producer Hitachi Denshi Ltd. (9) In September 2002  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1696/2002 (12)  amended Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus excluding them from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty. (10) In April 2004  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 825/2004  amended Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus excluding them from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty. B.   INVESTIGATION CONCERNING NEW MODELS OF PROFESSIONAL CAMERA SYSTEMS 1.   Procedure (11) Two Japanese exporting producers  namely Sony Corporation (‘Sony’) and Victor Company of Japan Limited (‘JVC’) informed the Commission that they intended to introduce new models of professional camera systems into the Community market and requested the Commission to add these new models of professional camera systems  including their accessories  to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus exempt them from the scope of the anti-dumping duties. (12) The Commission informed the Community industry accordingly and commenced an investigation limited to the determination of whether the products under consideration fall within the scope of the anti-dumping duties and whether the operational part of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 should be amended accordingly. 2.   Models under investigation (13) The requests for exemption were received for the following models of camera systems  supplied with the relevant technical information: (i) Sony: — viewfinder HDVF-C30W (ii) JVC: — Camera head KY-F560E 3.   Findings (i)   Viewfinder HDVF-C30W (14) It was found that viewfinder HDVF-C30W falls under the product description of Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. However  it can only be used with camera heads that do not fall under the product description of Article 1(2)(a) of that Regulation. In particular  the signal-to-noise ratio of these camera heads is 54 dB  whereas the description in Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 for the camera heads requires ‘55 dB or more at normal gain’. Therefore  it was concluded that this viewfinder should be regarded as a professional camera system falling within the definition of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. As a result  this viewfinder should be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. (15) In accordance with the established Community Institutions' practice  this model should be exempted from the duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore  all imports of Sony-Viewfinder HDVF-C30W imported on or after 1 April 2003 should be exempted from the duty from this date. (ii)   Camera head KY-F560E (16) It was found that camera head KY-F560E  although falling within the product description of Article 1(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000  is mainly used in technical and medical applications. It was therefore concluded that this model was to be regarded as a professional camera system falling within the definition of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. It should therefore be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. (17) In accordance with the established Community Institutions’ practice  this model should be exempted from the duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore  all imports of JVC-Camera head KY-F560E imported on or after 15 April 2004 should be exempted from the duty from this date. 4.   Information of the interested parties and conclusions (18) The Commission informed the Community industry and the exporters of the TCS of its findings and provided them with an opportunity to present their views. None of the parties objected to the Commission's findings. (19) On the basis of the foregoing  Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 should be amended accordingly ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In particular  Chapter V of that Annex provides for specific requirements for the processing of milk  milk products and colostrum. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 the provisions applicable to the importation of products referred to in Annexes VII and VIII to that Regulation from non-member countries are not to be more favourable or less favourable than those applicable to the production and marketing of those products in the Community. Chapter V of Annex VII to that Regulation should therefore be amended  in order to introduce certain technical amendments  to harmonise the processing standards for milk and milk products and to clarify the import requirements applicable to them. (4) Following the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority  adopted on 29 March 2006  related to the animal health risks of feeding animals with ready-to-use dairy products without further treatment (2)  it is appropriate to amend the specific hygiene requirements for milk  milk-based products and colostrums. Account should also be taken of the methods for the inactivation of possible foot-and-mouth disease virus in milk described in the 1999 Report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on a Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot-and-Mouth Disease (3) and of Appendix 3.6.2 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (4)  2005 edition  of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). (5) Taking account of the amended specific hygiene requirements in Chapter V of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002  it is appropriate to replace the model health certificates in Chapters 2(A)  2(B) and 2(C) of Annex X to that Regulation by a single model certificate for the importation from third countries of milk and milk products not intended for human consumption. (6) It is necessary to update the reference to the specific health certificate in Part I of Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 setting out lists of third countries from which Member States may authorise imports of animal by-products not intended for human consumption. (7) Annexes VII  X and XI to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.

However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination  quantities  qualities and presentations. (6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

650,COMMISSION DECISION  of 6 February 1991  on financial aid by the Federal Republic of Germany to the coal industry in 1990 and supplementary aid to the coal industry for 1989  (only the German text is authentic)  (91/406/ECSC) THE  COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community  Having regard to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of 30 June 1986 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry (1)  Whereas: I In its letters of 3 January and 8 October 1990  the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany informed the Commission  pursuant to Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC  of the financial measures it intends to take in order to support the coal  industry in 1990. In its letter of 8 October 1990  the German Government also informed the Commission  pursuant to Article 9 (3)  of a supplementary measure it intends to take in support of the coal industry with regard to 1989. Pursuant to the above Decision  the Commission must give a ruling on the following financial measures submitted to it for approval: - aid totalling DM 3 550 million to sales of coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry in 1990  - aid totalling DM 152 million under a scheme for maintaining the underground labour force in deep mines (Bergmannspraemie) for 1990  - aid totalling DM 20 million for special depreciation in 1990  - aid totalling DM 306 million to finance social benefit schemes in the coal industry in 1990  corresponding to the difference between actual and standard social charges  - supplementary aid totalling DM 982 million to sales of coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry in 1989. The measures which the German Government intends to take to support the coal industry comply with the provisions of Article 1 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC. The Commission must therefore give a ruling under Article 10 of the Decision as to whether  they comply with the objectives and criteria set out in that Decision and whether they are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market. II In accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Decision  coal undertakings are authorized  where necessary  to grant rebates on their list prices or production costs for deliveries to the Community iron and steel industry under long-term contract of coking  coal  blast furnace coke and coal for injection into blast furnaces. These rebates must not cause the delivered prices of Community coal and coke to work out lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries and coke made from  non-member country coking coal. Since 1 January 1989  the German Government's policy on aid to sales of coal and coke to the Community steel industry has been based on the principle of placing a ceiling on the amount of such aid for the years 1989  1990 and 1991. The overall amount of  aid planned for the period from 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1991 amounts to DM 10 960 million  while the total quantities eligible for this aid are expected to be 69 8 million tonnes. On 28 February 1990  the Commission adopted Decision No 90/199/ECSC (2) on aid from the Federal Republic of Germany to the coal industry in 1989. This Decision authorized the German Government to grant aid of DM 2 865 million under the new system to  sales of coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry. The Commission had noted in its Decision that the amount of aid  which corresponded to the budgetary resources available for the year 1989  would not cover the full amount necessary course  of that year to cover an estimated quantity of 24 5 million tonnes of coal and coke. By its letter of 8 October 1990  the German Government informed the Commission of the adjustment it intended to make to the amount authorized by the Decision. Compared with this amount  the additional sum for 1989 will be DM 982 million  bringing the  total amount of aid to sales of coal and coke for 1989 to DM 3 847 million. The German Government also plans to pay coal producers  within the framework of the budgetary resources available  a sum of DM 3 550 million for 1990  in respect of production of 23 8 million tonnes of coal and coke. In view of the notification  the Commission feels that the progressive reduction in aid which is one of the objectives of the new scheme is beginning to take effect. It notes in the light of the information supplied by the German Government that this  downward trend should become more marked in the course of 1991. The Commission welcomes both the principle of placing a ceiling on aid and its progressive reduction  which should help speed up restructuring of the coal industry and hence improve its competitiveness in conformity with the first indent of Article 2  (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC. Moreover  this aid is compatible with the provisions of Articles 4 and 12 of the Decision  as it does not lead to delivered prices lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries. It will also be necessary  pursuant to Article 11 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC  to ensure that this aid does not lead to discrimination within the meaning of the ECSC Treaty  as between Community buyers or users of coal or coke. The German Government is to communicate at the end of 1990 any changes with regard to sales and information relating to production costs and the guide price  in order to enable the Commission to ensure that all the abovementioned provisions are complied  with. III The aid of DM 152 million to finance mineworkers' bonuses (Bergmannspraemie) of DM 10 for every shift worked underground enables the undertakings to maintain a skilled underground workforce. This type of aid  which helps to increase productivity  is  specifically provided for in Article 6 of the Decision and contributes to an improvement of the competitiveness of the industry in accordance with the first indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision. The aid covering special depreciation improves the competitiveness of the coal industry in that it enables restructuring to be speeded-up. Since  at 0 1 % of the production cost  it is very low  this aid will not give the German coal undertakings a significant competitive advantage over other Community coal producers  especially since the returns do not cover the production costs. In view  of its purpose  this measure conforms to the objective specified in the first indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision. The information supplied to the Commission regarding aid to finance social benefit schemes in the coal industry shows that the aid which the German Government intends to grant for these purposes makes the ratio between the burden per mineworker in  employment and the benefits per person in receipt of benefit lower than the corresponding ratio in other industries. The difference between actual and standard charges in 1990 amounts to DM 306 million. Since the limits set in Article 7 of Decision No  2064/86/ECSC have thereby been exceeded  this must be considered as indirect aid to current production and must be examined on the basis of Article 10 (2) of the Decision. The reduction of about 1 % in production costs which it entails will not give the  German coal industry a significant competitive advantage over other Community coal producers. Since this measure reduces the industry's operating costs  it helps solve the social and regional problems relating to developments in the coal industry by  permitting a better phasing of restructuring and rationalization measures. It thus helps to achieve the objective referred to in the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision. IV Consequently  the aid measures referred to in this Decision are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market. This Decision does not prejudge the compatibility with Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of the amounts of aid scheduled by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the years following 1990 under the system it has established for aid to sales of  coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Provision should therefore be made for this Regulation to apply to Bulgaria from that date. (13) For Romania  the date of entry into force of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement is 1 August 2005. Provision should therefore be made for this Regulation to apply to Romania from that date.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in pigmeat  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162  163  164  167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination  especially where the world market situation  the specific requirements of certain markets  or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.

695,COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1025/97 of 6 June 1997 concerning imports of certain textile products originating in the Russian Federation THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements  protocols or other arrangements  or by other specific Community import rules (1)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1937/96 (2) and in particular Article 12 (2) and Article 17 (6)  in conjunction with Article 25 (5) thereof  Whereas the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and the Russian Federation on trade in textile products initialled on 19 December 1995 expired on 31 December 1996 and whereas  pending the resumption and completion of negotiations directed towards the initialling of a new agreement with the Russian Federation  Commission Regulation (EC) No 2446/96 (3) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 562/97 (4) was adopted in order to safeguard the economic interests of the Community in the further conduct of trade in textile products with that country; Whereas the measures brought in by that Regulation are to apply until 30 June 1997  by which date it appears unlikely that a new textiles agreement can be negotiated and brought into application; Whereas it is necessary  given the sensitivity of the textiles and clothing sector to introduce an import regime for the second six months of 1997 setting quantitative limits for imports of certain textile products originating in the Russian Federation; Whereas experience of administering the quantitative limits established by Regulation (EC) No 2446/96 has shown that for certain categories of products requests for import authorizations considerably exceeded the quantitative limits; whereas it is appropriate to introduce more precise criteria for management in order to ensure that requests for authorization of imports correspond to a real intention to import; whereas for this purpose the issue of an import authorization should be subject to the presentation of a contract; Whereas in order to allow as many traders as possible access to the quantitative limits it also appears appropriate to limit the quantities allocated by each licence to a maximum amount; whereas with a view to an optimal utilization of the quantitative limits it is also appropriate to provide that each operator is only able to present a new request for authorization of imports after having used 50 % of the quantity covered by a previously issued licence; Considering that with a view to ensuring an optimal utilization of the quantitative limits it is appropriate to fix the duration of validity of the import licences to three months from the date of their issue; Whereas in order to ensure the continuity of trade it is appropriate to introduce new quantitative limits covering the rest of the year 1997 and that these limits should be set by reference to the period covered together with an increase which does not prejudge the results of the negotiation of a new textiles agreement; Whereas for categories 2  2a  39  117 and 118  the quantitative limits for which were exhausted shortly after their introduction by Regulation (EC) No 2446/96  it is necessary in order to ensure the continuity of trade to render the new quantitative limits  under the new rules of management  accessible from the date of entry into force of this Regulation; Whereas for the other categories of products  for which the quantitative limits have not been completely exhausted it is appropriate that the new rules of management and the new quantitative limits be applicable following the date of expiry of Regulation (EC) No 2446/96  that is from 1 July 1997; Whereas it is necessary to make it clear that the provisions of this Regulation do not prevent imports of textile products covered by a valid import licence issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2446/96; Whereas in the interim the negotiations to reach a new bilateral agreement between the Community and the Russian Federation before the expiry of this present Regulation will continue; Whereas the reduced number of quantitative restrictions in comparison with those existing in the agreement as well as the increased levels provided for in this Regulation are introduced on the basis that the Russian Federation will not adopt  during the validity of this Regulation  measures in the textiles and clothing sector concerning quantitative restrictions  or increased tariffs or non-tariff barriers such as certification or other import requirements applicable to import of products originating in the Community  other than those measures in force in the Russian Federation at the date of 1st January 1996; whereas the introduction of any such measure will therefore entail a review of the provisions of this Regulation; Whereas these measures conform to the opinion delivered by the Committee set up by Regulation (EC) No 517/94 ,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Such a development would be likely to cause budget problems for the Community; (2) an intervention threshold was fixed for tomatoes for the 1999 marketing year in Commission Regulation (EC) No 13/1999(3). Since the conditions laid down in the abovementioned Article 27 continue to be met for that product  a new threshold should be set for the 2000 marketing year equal to that set for the 1999 marketing year  and the period to be taken into account for the assessment of the overrun of the threshold should also be determined; (3) pursuant to the abovementioned Article 27  an overrun of the intervention threshold results in a reduction in the Community withdrawal compensation in the marketing year following the year in which the threshold is exceeded. The consequences of such an overrun should be determined and a reduction in proportion to the size of the overrun fixed  but restricted to a certain percentage; (4) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables ,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

705,"COMMISSION DECISION of 25 February 1998 concerning aid which Germany intends to grant under the 26th framework plan of the joint scheme for improving regional economic structures with a view to promoting teleworking (26. Rahmenplan der Gemeinschaftsaufgabe ""Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur"") (notified under document number C(1998) 585) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (1999/686/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular Articles 92 and 93 thereof  Having regard to the Agreement establishing the European Economic Area  and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof  Having given notice to the other Member States and the parties concerned to submit their comments within a stated period  in accordance with Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty  Whereas: I On 30 July 1997 the Commission initiated the procedure provided for in Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty with regard to the provisions of the 26th framework plan of the joint Federal Government/Länder scheme for improving regional economic structures concerning the intensities of aid to promote teleworking (section II  point 2.4). Germany was informed of the decision by letter dated 18 August 1997 (SG(97) D/7104). The other Member States and interested parties were invited to submit their comments by way of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities(1). Germany submitted its observations by letter dated 17 September 1997. The Commission received no comments from third parties or the other Member States. II The joint (Federal Government/Länder) scheme for improving regional economic structures (Gemeinschaftsaufgabe ""Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur"") is the main regional aid scheme in Germany. The relevant provisions implementing this general scheme during certain periods are laid down in so-called framework plans (Rahmenpläne). The 26th framework plan  covering the period 1997-2000 (2001)  was notified to the Commission on 19 February 1997 pursuant to Article 93(3). The Commission approved all the amendments introduced by this plan  except those relating to the promotion of investment in teleworking. Germany informed the Commission that the plan would not be implemented until the Commission had given its approval. Under the plan  investment in teleworking jobs would be eligible for regional investment aid provided that both the company investing and the place where the teleworker would be located are in an assisted area. The maximum aid intensity would be established according to the region where the investing company to which the teleworking job will be linked is located. Consequently  in cases where a company located in an assisted area falling under Article 92(3)(a) invested in teleworking jobs in an area falling under Article 92(3)(c)  the aid intensity for the Article 92(3)(a) region would apply. The maximum aid intensity in the regions of eastern Germany falling under Article 92(3)(a) is 35 % gross (50 % in case of investments by SMEs); in assisted areas of western Germany falling under Article 92(3)(c)  the maximum permissible aid intensity is 18 % gross (28 % in case of investment by SMEs). The Commission  in opening the procedure  noted that the principal aim of the provisions governing regional investment aid is to promote job creation  improve incomes and foster demand in disadvantaged regions and that  consequently  the maximum aid intensities for investment aid should be determined by reference to the region where the investment was located and the teleworking carried out. It also took the view that the possibility of promoting teleworking jobs in an Article 92(3)(c) region to the same extent as in an Article 92(3)(a) region could mean that the intended incentive effect in the most disadvantaged regions would not be achieved through this type of investment. III Germany is of the opinion that investment in teleworking jobs would be most effective in the area where the investing company is located. Therefore  such investment should always qualify for the aid intensities permissible in the area where the investor  and not the job  is located  provided that both areas are assisted area. Companies located in an Article 92(3)(c) assisted area and investing in teleworking jobs in Article 92(3)(a) areas would consequently benefit only from the lower intensity applicable at their place of establishment. Germany also maintains that there is no risk of aid being diverted from an Article 92(3)(a) area to an Article 92(3)(c) area. Since aid for investment in different Länder would always necessiatate the cooperation of  and co-financing from  at least two Länder  the competent authority in the Article 92(3)(a) area could always make sure that no aid was abusively diverted in favour of job creation in the other Land. Lastly  Germany argued that the positive impact of teleworking on innovation and competitiveness would invariably benefit the investing company  with the amount of investment at the location of the teleworking job generally being rather limited. If certain services supplied by specialised workers were not available in an Article 92(3)(a) area  a company investing in such an area would be obliged to offer them the opportunity to work at their place of residence in an Article 92(3)(c) area in order to obtain their services. IV The provision whereby aid intensities for investment in teleworking jobs that exceed the maximum level are allowed in the region where the teleworking job would be located cannot be deemed compatible with the common market. The particularly high aid intensities permissible with a view to promoting regional development in disadvantaged areas falling under Article 92(3)(a) are designed to provide and effective remedy for the abnormally low standard of living and serious level of underemployment in those areas. Consenquently  only measures that contribute towards a higher standard of living and job creation in an Article 92(3)(a) area are eligible for investment aid up to an intensity permissible solely for such an area. Investment made by companies in such disadvantaged areas with a view to installing the technical equipment and links for teleworking jobs in another assisted area eligible only for assistance under Article 92(3)(c) does not increase the level of employment and the general standard of living in the Article 92(3)(a) area. Employment increases only in the area where the employee is located and the main impact on regional per capita GDP is felt primarily at the location where the employee spends his income. It is true that access to skilled manpower can be a crucial factor determining the innovativeness and competitiveness of companies investing in Article 92(3)(a) regions. If such specialists are not available on the local job market and cannot be tempted to move from other areas by the offer of attractive wages  teleworking opportunities are clarly an option for connecting the company to resources that already exist in more developed areas. However  the main impact this has on regional per capita GDP and on the level of employment would be felt in regions where the teleworker is located  provided there is no serious underemployment  and where he spends his income. This observation forms the basis for the Commission recommendation on promoting teleworking in disadvantaged regions so as to enable employees to offer their services to companies in more developed regions without leaving their place of residence. In this way  the population in disadvantaged regions could be stabilised and regional GDP increased by the teleworker's income(2). Germany apparently assumes that the authorities in an Article 92(3)(a) region would always expect from the authorities in the region where the job was to be located a contribution towards investment aid reflecting the scale of investment undertaken there. The provision in question would therefore allow Article 92(3)(c) regions to grant aid for promoting teleworking jobs in their region at an intensity permissible only in Article 92(3)(a) regions. Such an option would  however  diminish the intended incentive effect of the increased level of investment aid in the most disadvantaged regions and could contribute towards a scenario whereby investment would go primarily into jobs for less skilled employees while better skilled employees who  because of their position on the labour market  have no need to move to a less attractive area would remain in more developed regions. As a result  it would mainly be persons earning above average wages and with skills in the engineering  software  management and consultancy sectors who would have no incentive to move to disadvantaged regions and thereby to contribute towards a balanced socio-economic development of those regions. V The Commission therefore concludes that the provision of the 26th framework plan of the joint scheme for improving regional economic structures that permits aid intensities for investments in teleworking jobs in excess of the maximum intensity allowed in the region where the relevant job would be located is not compatible with the common market and should not  therefore  be put into effect ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) Belgium and Germany have each established a programme of actions to eradicate organisms harmful to plants introduced in their territories.

735,Commission Regulation (EC) No 353/2002 of 25 February 2002 fixing certain indicative quantities and individual ceilings for the issuing of licences for importing bananas into the Community under the tariff quotas for the second quarter of 2002 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2587/2001(2)  and in particular Article 20 thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 14(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 of 7 May 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 349/2002(4)  provides for the possibility of fixing an indicative quantity  expressed as the same percentage of quantities available under each of the tariff quotas  for the purposes of issuing import licences for the first three quarters of the year. (2) The data relating  on the one hand  to the quantities of bananas marketed in the Community in 2001  and in particular actual imports  especially during the second quarter  and  on the other hand  to the outlook for supply and consumption on the Community market in the same quarter of 2002 call for the fixing of indicative quantities for quotas A  B and C that ensure satisfactory supply to the Community as a whole and continuity of trade flows between the production and marketing sectors. (3) On the basis of the same data  the ceiling on the quantities for which individual operators can submit licence applications in respect of the second quarter of 2002 should be fixed for the purposes of Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001. (4) The quantities fixed must also take account of the tariff quota quantities provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2587/2001  and of the allocation of tariff quota C between traditional and non-traditional operators as determined by Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 349/2002. (5) Within tariff quota C  the indicative quantity and the maximum per operator should be fixed at a satisfactory level that enables operators to adapt to the reduced quantity of the tariff quota and to the new allocation among the categories of operators and to take account of the amounts fixed as a precaution for the first quarter in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2294/2001(5). In order to prevent disturbance of import flows  provision should be made  at the specific request of the operator  for licences to be issued forthwith on submission of the application. (6) Since this Regulation must apply before the beginning of the period for the submission of licence applications in respect of the second quarter of 2002  it should enter into force immediately.

(2) Annex IVa to Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005  of 22 December 2004  fixing for 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks  applicable in Community waters and  for Community vessels  in waters where catch limitations are required (3)  lays down interim fishing effort limitations and additional conditions for monitoring  inspection and surveillance in the context of certain stocks recovery measures applicable to all fisheries likely to catch cod in the Kattegatt  the North Sea  the Skagerrak and the Eastern Channel  the West of Scotland and the Irish Sea. (3) To ensure the success of those measures  it is necessary to establish a specific monitoring programme involving Belgium  Denmark  Germany  France  Ireland  the Netherlands  Sweden and the United Kingdom  with the objective of guaranteeing an appropriate level of implementation of the conservation and control measures applicable to fishing activities in relation to the recovery of cod stocks. (4) That specific monitoring programme should be defined for a period of two years and may be revised in the light of the adoption of new conservation measures or at the request of a Member State. The results obtained by the application of the specific monitoring programme should be periodically evaluated in cooperation with the Member States concerned. Where appropriate  that programme may be amended. (5) In order to harmonise the inspection and surveillance of the relevant fisheries at Community level  it is appropriate to draw up common rules for the inspection and surveillance activities to be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned  and that Member States adopt national control programmes in order to match such common rules. To that end  benchmarks for the intensity of inspection and surveillance activities should be fixed  as well as inspection priorities and inspection procedures. (6) Exchanges of national inspectors between the Member States concerned should be encouraged so as to enhance uniformity of inspection and surveillance practices and help develop the coordination of the control activities between the competent authorities of those Member States. (7) To ensure the follow-up of infringements in accordance with Article 25 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy (4)  a framework should be set up under which all the authorities concerned may request mutual assistance and exchange relevant information in accordance with Articles 34a and 34b of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 and Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.

(2) Germany still has intervention stocks of barley. (3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community  cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/2004 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally  causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry  which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices. (4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of barley held by the German intervention agency available on the internal market  which had earlier been destined for export under Commission Regulation (EC) No 668/2001(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1093/2003(6)  and to repeal that Regulation. (5) To take account of the situation on the Community market  provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender; in addition  provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price. (6) When the German intervention agency notifies the Commission  the tenderers should remain anonymous.

749,COMMISSION DECISION of 21 December 1998 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain laser optical reading systems  and the main constituent elements thereof  for use in motor vehicles  originating in Japan  Korea  Malaysia  the People's Republic of China and Taiwan (notified under document number C(1998) 4329) (1999/55/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2)  and in particular Article 9 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE 1. Initiation (1) On 12 September 1997  a complaint was lodged pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter 'the Basic Regulation`)  by the Association for Laser Optical Reading Systems on behalf of Community producers whose collective output represented significantly more than 50 % of the total Community production of certain laser optical reading systems for use in motor vehicles (LORS). The complaint contained sufficient evidence of injurious dumping to justify the opening of an anti-dumping proceeding. (2) On 25 October 1997  the Commission announced by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the European Community of LORS originating in Japan  Korea  Malaysia  the People's Republic of China (hereinafter 'the PRC`) and Taiwan and commenced an investigation. 2. Investigation period (3) The investigation period for the determination of dumping covered the period from l October 1996 to 30 September 1997 (hereinafter referred to as 'the investigation period`). The examination of injury covers the period January 1994 to the end of the investigation period. B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT 1. General remarks (4) In the notice of initiation  the Commission had defined the product scope as laser optical reading systems comprising compact disc tuners (CD tuners)  disc-changers and car radios with a disc control device (car radio). (5) The further investigation has firstly established that the above elements taken together cannot be regarded as a 'system` forming one single product  in spite of certain given functional links existing between these elements  as this would require that the elements could only properly function together. Indeed  the car radio can function on its own and does also not contain a laser optical reading mechanism. A CD tuner likewise can function on its own. The disc-changer is the only element which must be linked to one of the other elements in order to function. However  this cannot be considered sufficient to characterise all three elements taken together as a system and thus one single product. (6) Secondly  the investigation has by the same token established that the product coverage would encompass  with respect to car radios  a large percentage of these elements even if they are used outside the laser optical reading system  i.e. if they would not be used to reproduce CDs. (7) For these reasons  it is considered that the abovementioned three elements cannot be regarded as one system consisting of one single product. Therefore  given the results of the investigation  it was necessary to assess the three products separately  namely car radios  CD tuners and disc-changers. 2. Car radios (8) With respect to car radios  the Community industry has agreed on reducing the product concerned by the present proceeding to CD tuners and disc-changers by withdrawing the complaint as far as car radios are concerned. As the investigation has not revealed any Community interest grounds to continue with the proceeding in the absence of a complaint  the proceeding with respect to car radios should thus be terminated in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Basic Regulation. 3. CD tuners 3.1. Product under consideration and like product (9) CD tuners are products which incorporate in a single housing a compact disc player  able to reproduce (read) digital audio signals (essentially music) stored on one or more CDs  without having the ability to record such audio signals (CN codes 8527 21 20 and 8527 21 70). A CD tuner generally also incorporates a radio broadcast receiver. In this respect it was established that CD tuners manufactured and sold by the Community producers in the Community market are alike  or closely resemble  CD tuners manufactured in and sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. Furthermore  CD tuners sold in the countries concerned are also alike  or closely resemble  CD tuners sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. All these products therefore are to be considered a single product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the Basic Regulation. 3.2. Dumping and injury (10) The investigation established the existence of dumping and injury. However  given the conclusions as set out below  it is not necessary to detail these findings. 3.3. Causation (11) Pursuant to Articles 3(6) and 3(7) of the Basic Regulation  it was examined whether the imports concerned have caused material injury or whether the injury was caused by effects other than dumping. (12) In this respect  the market share of the dumped imports decreased by nine percentage points between 1994 and the investigation period  i.e. from around 61 % to around 52 %  while Community consumption increased by around 129 % during the same period of time. This indicates that the exporters from the countries concerned  while increasing their exports in absolute terms  did not do so to an extent reflecting the massive expansion of the consumption in the Community. Prices of the exporters have declined by more than 18 % between 1994 and the investigation period. By comparison  the Community industry only reduced their prices by around 8 %. Limited price undercutting was found for the imports concerned. In addition  it mainly concerned non-homogeneous products with a great variety of features and technical differences and subject to rapid technological development. Therefore  the effects of the undercutting cannot be found to have had a clear material impact on the Community industry's prices. (13) The Commission has also examined other factors that may have had an effect on the situation of the Community industry. With respect to other third countries  between 1994 and the investigation period  their import volumes have increased significantly more than both the consumption and the imports from the countries concerned  i.e. by 700 % (from around 67 000 units to around 500 000 units)  and their market shares also went up considerably by 16 percentage points  from around 8 % to around 24 %. This shows that these other imports have fully participated in and even increased more quickly than the expansion found for the Community consumption. As regards prices  limited information gathered from certain cooperating interested parties may indicate that there has been high price undercutting by these imports. The increase of the market share of the imports from third countries by 16 percentage points  seen in comparison to the loss of market share of the exports from the countries concerned of around nine percentage points  and the loss of the Community industry of two percentage points  demonstrates that the exports from the countries concerned have been more than fully replaced by the imports from the abovementioned third countries. Indeed  it appears that the market shares of both the Community industry and the exporters from the countries concerned suffered from these imports. (14) In view of the above and particular attention paid to imports from other third countries  it would appear that imports from the countries concerned did not in isolation have a materially injurious impact on the situation of the Community industry. Imports from other third countries have contributed to such an extent to the precarious situation of the Community industry that they should be considered as breaking the causal link between the dumping and the injury found. 3.4. Conclusion (15) The proceeding with respect to CD tuners should therefore be terminated. 4. Disc-changers 4.1. Product under consideration and like product (16) With respect to disc-changers  these are sound-reproducing apparatus with a laser reading system usually placed in the boot of a motor vehicle (CN code ex 8519 99 18). They are able to store and process several CDs. In order to function and to reproduce sounds  they must be connected to a 'head` unit with a disc control device (usually a car radio). In this respect the investigation has established that disc-changers manufactured and sold by the Community industry in the Community market are alike  or closely resemble  disc-changers manufactured in and sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. Furthermore  disc-changers sold in the countries concerned are also alike  or closely resemble  disc-changers sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. All these products therefore are to be considered a single product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the Basic Regulation. 4.2. Dumping  injury and causation (17) The investigation established the existence of injurious dumping. However  given the conclusions as set out below  it is not necessary to detail these findings. 4.3. Community interest (18) When assessing the Community interest aspects of the present case  the Commission examined the likely costs and benefits that the imposition of measures would have on the economic operators concerned. The market share of the Community industry started from 0 % in 1996 but still only reached 1 4 % during the investigation period. On the basis of an average duty of 20 % on the imports value of the product concerned  the amount of duties imposed on imports of this product would represent between 6 and 10 times the total value of production of the Community industry during the investigation period. Even if production were to be expanded in accordance with the plans of the Community industry  the total value of production would  in the foreseeable future  only be a fraction of the amount of duties imposed. The above situation results from the fact that around 81 % of the disc-changers sold within the Community during the investigation period originated in the countries under investigation. In addition  when setting up its production  the Community industry was well aware that it was doing so in an environment of depressed prices. Disc-changers had been on the market for a number of years and have indeed been imported by the Community industry  mainly from Japan. The Community industry only commenced with its Community activity in 1996  when the product was already well-established on the market  i.e. at a very late stage. Under these circumstances it is difficult to assess the future development of the industry and the possible beneficial effect of measures. Furthermore  the overall advantages to be gained by the Community industry in this particular situation  which are likely to be minimal given the relatively low level of employment immediately affected  must be weighed against the probable disadvantages  in particular for consumers. Indeed  the product under consideration is a widespread consumer electronics product with a large growth potential. It is likely that the imposition of duties would severely limit consumer choice  as many exporters  especially those with high duties  would be likely to withdraw from the Community market. This loss of choice as regards the current variety of models available could not be compensated in the foreseeable future by the Community industry. The current high market presence of these exporters and the fact that they offer a wide model range comprising high quality products would mean that  if they were to withdraw  consumers would be deprived of taking advantage of technological variety and development  without having any viable alternative in the foreseeable future. In this situation it is considered that the interests of consumers are by far outweighing the interests of the Community industry. In such a situation  it can be considered that the imposition of measures would disproportionately affect importers  traders and consumers of the product concerned. Conclusion on Community interest (19) In view of all the above  compelling reasons exist on Community interest grounds not to adopt anti-dumping measures as regards imports of disc-changers from the countries concerned. 4.4. Conclusion (20) Under these circumstances  the proceeding with respect to disc-changers should be terminated on the grounds of Community interest. C.

Whereas  to protect animal and human health in the Community  the Commission adopted Decision 94/474/EC of 27 July 1994 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and repealing Decisions 89/469/EEC and 90/200/EEC (4)  as last amended by Decision 95/287/EC (5)  Decision 92/290/EEC of 14 May 1992 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine embryos in respect of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom (6)  as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria  Finland and Sweden  Decision 94/381/EC of 27 June 1994 concerning certain protection measures with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the feeding of mammalian derived protein (7)  as amended by Decision 95/60/EC (8)  Decision 94/382/EC of 27 June 1994 on the approval of alternative heat treatment systems for processing animal waste of ruminant origin  with a view to the inactivation of spongiform encephalopathy agents (9)  as amended by Decision 95/29/EC (10)  and Decision 96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (11)  as amended by Decision 96/362/EC (12); Whereas  upon the publication in March 1996 of new information on certain cases of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease where the link to BSE could not be ruled out  Community bodies have recognized that decisive action must be taken in order to control and finally eradicate BSE; Whereas Portugal has had cases of BSE in its native cattle; Whereas in April 1996 Portugal presented to the Commission a plan laying down supplementary measures to control and eradicate BSE in Portugal  hereafter referred to as 'the plan`; Whereas the principal elements of the plan are: (a) compulsory slaughter of animals identified as imported from the United Kingdom  all animals in herds where cases of BSE have occurred and all animals in other herds identified as belonging to the same birth cohort as affected animals; (b) an improved system of health monitoring of holdings with bovine animals and intensified surveillance of the feed manufacturing industry to prevent the possible use of meat-and-bone meal; Whereas a programme to control BSE and reduce the number of future cases should concentrate on removal of animals most likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal in accordance with the principle laid down in point 6 of the conclusions of the Council meeting of 1 to 3 April 1996; Whereas the Council concluded that such an option should be open to Member States other than the United Kingdom on a case-by-case basis; Whereas  however  there are factors in Portugal which make it difficult in practice to identify animals within herds that are most likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal in view of low herd size and the lack of full data for the identification of high-risk groups; Whereas  consequently  the Commission can accept under these particular circumstances and in order to restore consumer confidence that a whole herd slaughter policy be adopted for Portugal in relation to BSE to be financed with a Community contribution on the basis of the same principles and in accordance with the same procedure as laid down in points 8 and 9 of the conclusions of the Council meeting of 1 to 3 April 1996; Whereas the Commission  in accordance with point 9 of those Council conclusions  has adopted Regulation (EC) No 716/96 (13)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 835/96 (14)  and Regulation (EC) No 717/96 (15)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 841/96 (16)  in order to provide market support; Whereas a similar measure will be proposed in order to provide for financial assistance to Portugal for the present plan; Whereas the plan amended on 12 June 1996 will contribute to the reduction in the number of BSE cases and increase the controls relating to the disease  and it should therefore be approved; Whereas the Commission should carry out Community inspections in Portugal to verify the application of the measures approved by this Decision; Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
757,13.3.2014 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 73/5 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION of 11 March 2014 rejecting the refusal of authorisations of biocidal products containing bromadiolone notified by Germany in accordance with Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (notified under document C(2014) 1362) (Text with EEA relevance) (2014/133/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1)  and in particular Article 36(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) contained the list of active substances approved at Union level for use in biocidal products. Commission Directive 2009/92/EC (3) added the active substance bromadiolone for use in products belonging to product-type 14  Rodenticides  as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC. (2) In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 98/8/EC  the companies Pelgar International Limited and Unichem d.o.o. (‘the applicants’) submitted applications to the United Kingdom for authorisation of biocidal products containing bromadiolone as a wax block formulation (‘the contested products’). The United Kingdom authorised before 1 September 2013 the contested products for a number of uses including professional application in and around buildings and in sewers. A number of Member States have subsequently authorised the contested products through mutual recognition. (3) The German competent authority for biocidal products received applications for mutual recognition of authorisations according to Article 4(1) of Directive 98/8/EC for the contested products. (4) Germany has notified the Commission  the other Member States and the applicants of its proposal to refuse the authorisations in accordance with Article 4(4) of Directive 98/8/EC  as Germany considers that the contested products do not meet the requirements of Article 5(1) of Directive 98/8/EC with regard to effects on human health. (5) According to the notifications  Germany disagrees with the evaluation carried out by the United Kingdom regarding the dermal absorption value used in such evaluation (0 04 %). Germany considers this value as inappropriate according to OEDC standards on in vitro dermal absorption methods (4) and pointed out that based on a more conservative value of 0 36 % as per these standards the assessment results in an unacceptable dermal exposure to bromadiolone for professional users. (6) For each notification  the Commission invited the other Member States and the applicants to submit comments to the notification in writing within 90 days in accordance with Article 27(1) of Directive 98/8/EC. Comments were submitted within that deadline by the United Kingdom  Belgium  Germany and one of the applicants. The notification was also discussed between Commission representatives and representatives of Member States’ Competent Authorities for biocidal products in the meeting of the Product Authorisation and Mutual Recognition Facilitation Group of 14 May 2013. (7) From the abovementioned discussions and comments  it follows that the United Kingdom carried out the evaluation of the dermal absorption in a way which is compatible with the latest agreed EU guidance (5)  pursuant to which the possibility of reading across existing data from the active substance approval is accepted. (8) First  the United Kingdom used a dermal absorption value from a study considered as reliable in the context of the EU approval of the active substance bromadiolone  to which the applicants held the required letter of access from the data owner. Second  the dermal absorption study from which that value was obtained was carried out with a similar bait formulation to that of the contested products  as recommended by the abovementioned guidance. (9) Finally  the United Kingdom evaluated the product with the benefit of expert judgment to justify that the specific conditions of the study from which the dermal absorption value was obtained resembled more closely the actual exposure conditions for professional users loading wax blocks in bait stations. This approach is compatible with the abovementioned guidance and the common principles for the evaluation of dossiers for biocidal products as provided for by paragraph 12 of Annex VI to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. (10) In the light of the above arguments  the Commission supports the conclusions of the assessment carried out by the United Kingdom and the other Member States having authorised the contested products through mutual recognition that they do not have unacceptable effects on human health  as required by Article 5(1) of Directive 98/8/EC. The Commission therefore considers that the request by Germany to refuse the authorisations cannot be justified on the grounds put forward. (11) Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 shall apply to the contested products in accordance with the provisions of Article 92(2) of that Regulation. Since the legal basis for this Decision is Article 36(3) of that Regulation  this decision should be addressed to all Member States by virtue of Article 36(4) of that Regulation.

(2) The Portuguese fisheries authorities noticed that the catch reports on which these 2012 catch figures are based were not correctly transmitted to the Commission. This was confirmed by an independent audit. (3) On the basis of the corrected data transmitted by Portugal on 14 November 2013  it appears that the Portuguese quota for redfish in NAFO area 3LN (RED/N3LN) was overfished by a lower amount than that taken into account for the purpose of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 770/2013. (4) The deduction from the 2013 Portuguese quota for redfish in NAFO area 3LN should therefore be corrected as regards figures concerning the overfishing of the quota concerned. (5) Considering that this Implementing Regulation is amending deductions already operated on the redfish in NAFO area 3LN quota for 2013  its provisions should apply retroactively from the date of entry into force of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 770/2013. (6) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 770/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.

(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.

(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.

Article 6(7) of the 2003 Act of Accession establishes that the new Member States are to apply the common trade policy concerning textiles and that the quantitative restrictions applied by the Community on imports of textile and clothing products are to be adjusted to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the Community. (2) With effect from 1 May 2004  Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 (1) was last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 487/2004 (2). It adjusted the quantitative limits for imports of certain textile products from third countries into the enlarged Community  taking into account traditional imports into the 10 new Member States and using a formula of the average imports of years 2000 to 2002 adjusted pro rata temporis. This same methodology should now be applied to adjust the quantitative limits for imports of certain textile products from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

804,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1732/2003 of 30 September 2003 fixing the export refunds on beef and veal THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2)  and in particular Article 33(12) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 32/82(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 744/2000(4)  Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2772/2000(6)  Regulation (EEC) No 2388/84(7)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3661/92(8)  Regulation (EEC) No 2973/79(9)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3434/87(10)  and Regulation (EC) No 2051/96(11)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2333/96(12)  lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products  and for certain destinations. (3) It follows from applying those rules and criteria to the foreseeable situation on the market in beef and veal that the refund should be as set out below. (4) With regard to live animals  for reasons of simplification export refunds should no longer be granted for categories with insignificant trade with third countries. Moreover  in light of the general concern of animal welfare  export refunds for live animals for slaughter should be limited as much as possible. Consequently  export refunds for such animals should only be granted for third countries which for cultural and/or religious reasons traditionally import substantial numbers of animals for domestic slaughter. As to live animals for reproduction  in order to prevent any abuse export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age. (5) Export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some fresh or chilled meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0201  on some frozen meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0202  on some meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 0206 and on some other prepared or preserved meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 1602 50 10. (6) In the case of meat of bovine animals  boned or boneless  salted and dried  there are traditional trade flows to Switzerland. To allow this trade to continue  the refund should be set to cover the difference between prices on the Swiss market and export prices in the Member States. (7) In the case of certain other cuts and preserves of meat or offal shown in the Annex under CN codes 1602 50 31 to 1602 50 80  the Community presence of international trade may be maintained by granting a refund corresponding to that at present available. (8) In the case of other beef and veal products  a refund need not be fixed since the Community's share of world trade is not significant. (9) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(13)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(14)  establishes the agricultural product nomenclature for the purposes of export refunds. (10) In order to simplify customs export formalities for operators  the refunds on all frozen cuts should be brought into line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals. (11) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products(15)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/2003(16). (12) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore  to be eligible for a refund  products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(17)  as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(18)  Council Directive 94/65/EC(19)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003  and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(20)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(21)  respectively. (13) Under Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82  the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %  but not less than 85 %  of the total weight of cuts produced by boning. (14) The negotiations on the adoption of additional concessions  held within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and the associated central and eastern European Countries  aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market in beef and veal. To this end  it was decided to abolish export refunds on products intended for export to Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Rumania and Slovakia. These countries should therefore be excluded from the list of destinations giving rise to the grant of a refund  while ensuring that the abolition of refunds for these countries may not lead to the creation of a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

806,5.6.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 146/9 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 499/2008 of 4 June 2008 amending Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 and Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 as regards the conditions of granting export refunds on agricultural products THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (1)  and in particular Article 63 thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (2)  and in particular Article 167 and Article 170 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof  Whereas: (1) In accordance with Article 162 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 products listed in that article to be exported with or without further processing may be eligible to export refunds if they comply with specific conditions laid down in Article 167 of the said Regulation. Moreover  Article 167(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 gives the possibility to the Commission to establish further conditions for the granting of export refunds for one or more products. Those conditions are currently laid down in the Council regulations on the common organisation of the market in the sectors listed in Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Since those regulations are to be repealed pursuant to Article 201 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007  horizontal provisions should be established as from the dates of application of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as provided for in Article 204 of that Regulation. (2) Horizontal provisions already exist in Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3). It is therefore appropriate to adapt that Regulation in order to establish the conditions referred to in Article 167(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) Council regulations on the common organisation of the markets in the poultry  eggs  pigmeat and rice sectors enabled eligibility to export refunds for non-Community originating products which were imported and subsequently exported while they were not sufficiently processed within the meaning of Article 24 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (4). The refunds in that case are limited to the import duties paid and in addition the exporter had to prove that import and export products are one and the same. As the application of the rule is cumbersome and of very low practical use  from a point of view of simplification and harmonisation it should not be maintained. (4) Community origin as a prerequisite for eligibility to export refunds is an important safeguard against abuse of the Community budget. In particular  it is aimed at preventing diversion of trade in the form of import operations which would have no commercial purpose related to the placing of goods on the EU market  but which would be motivated solely by the opportunity to collect export refunds upon export. This safeguard has been in place for the cereals  rice  beef and veal  milk and milk products  pigmeat  eggs and poultrymeat and should be maintained. In the interest of continuous protection against abuse of the Community budget  a horizontal provision covering all sectors listed in Article 162 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is necessary. (5) As regards sugar  with a view to organising flow of supplies to refineries throughout the Community  special preferential arrangement for access to the Community market has been introduced in the successive common market organisations for sugar  allowing the refining industry to import on special terms certain quantities of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States party to Protocol No 3 to Annex IV to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and in India and other States under agreements with those States. This preferential import arrangement has been implemented within the framework of the common organisation of the market in sugar. Consequently  Article 27(12) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (5) provided that refunds had to be granted for the products imported under this arrangement. Following the same approach  the Council decided that the proof of Community origin had not to be required for eligibility of refunds under the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector established by Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 (6). The requirement of Community origin should therefore not apply to the sugar sector. (6) Pursuant to the abolition of export refunds for some products  the list of products for which the refunds has to be fixed on the basis of an ingredient when compound products qualify for a refund became shorter. It is therefore appropriate to mention only the remaining products in this respect. (7) The requirement of Community origin in the cereals sector has already been laid down in Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals (7). For the sake of transparency and rationalisation this requirement should be replaced by the horizontal provision establishing the requirement of Community origin. (8) Regulations (EC) No 1501/95 and (EC) No 800/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1948/2002(5)  allows the Commission to fix  in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and on the basis of the tenders submitted  a maximum export refund. In fixing this maximum  the criteria provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 must be taken into account. A contract is awarded to any tenderer whose tender is equal to or less than the maximum export refund. (3) The application of the abovementioned criteria to the current market situation for the rice in question results in the maximum export refund being fixed at the amount specified in Article 1.

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals (2).

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURES (1) The Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94(2)  imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems (hereinafter ""TCS"") originating in Japan. (2) The Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty the professional camera systems listed in the Annex to that Regulation (hereinafter referred to as ""the Annex"")  representing high-end professional camera systems technically falling within the product definition under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1015/94  but which cannot be regarded as broadcast cameras. (3) In October 1995  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 2474/95(3)  amended the abovementioned Regulation (EC) No 1015/94  in particular as regards the like product definition and as regards certain models of professional camera systems explicitly exempted from the scope of the definitive anti-dumping duty.

Furthermore  the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty certain new models of professional camera systems adding them to the Annex. (5) In January 1999  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 193/1999(5) amended Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to its Annex and thus excluding those from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty. B. INVESTIGATION CONCERNING NEW MODELS OF PROFESSIONAL CAMERA SYSTEMS 1. Procedure (6) Subsequently  a number of Japanese exporting producers informed the Commission that they intended to introduce new models of professional camera systems into the Community market and requested to add these new models of professional camera systems and their accessories to the Annex and thus exempt them from the scope of the anti-dumping duties. (7) The Commission informed the Community industry accordingly and commenced an investigation limited to the determination of whether the products under consideration fall within the scope of the anti-dumping duties and whether the operational part of Regulation 1015/94 should be amended accordingly. 2. Models under investigation (8) Applications were received for the following models of professional camera systems  supplied with the relevant technical information: (i) Hitachi Denshi  Ltd. (hereinafter ""Hitachi"") - Camera head V-21  which was presented as a successor model of camera head Z-ONE.DA  and which was sold without a triax adaptor; - new accessories to V-21: - 1.5 inch viewfinder GM-9  which was presented as the standard viewfinder for camera head model V-21; - camera adaptor CA-Z31 and CA-Z32  which were presented as successor models of camera adaptors CA-Z1A and CA-Z2 already included in the Annex  and which are to be connected with the camera head model V-21; - camera control panel RC-Z2A and RC-Z21A  which were presented as successor models of camera control panels RC-Z2 and RC-Z21  already included in the Annex; - Camera head V-21 W  which was presented as the wide screen version of camera head V-21; - 5 inch viewfinder GM-51  which was presented as the standard viewfinder for camera head model V-21W; All above models are sold without a corresponding triax system or triax adaptor. (ii) Olympus Winter &  IBE GmbH (hereinafter ""Olympus"") - camera control unit OTV-S6  which was represented as a model used in the medical sector and as a successor model of OTV-S5  already included in the Annex. (iii) Matsushita - camera head AW-F575HE  which was presented as a successor model of camera head WV-F565HE already included in the Annex; - camera adaptor AW-AD500AE and AW-AD700BSE  which were presented as successor models of camera adaptor WV-AD500E and WV-AD700ASE already included in the Annex. (iv) Ikegami Tsushinki Co  Ltd (hereinafter ""Ikegami"") - camera head HC-400 and HC-400W  which were presented as successor models of camera head HC 390 already included in the Annex. - new accessories to camera head HC-400 and HC-400W - viewfinders VF 15-46; - operational control panel RCU-390; - camera adaptor CA-400; - camera control unit MA-200A; All above models are sold without a corresponding triax system or triax adaptor. (v) Victor Company of Japan  Ltd (hereinafter ""JVC"") - camera head KY-D29WECH  which was presented as a wide-screen version of the predecessor model KY-D29ECH already included in the Annex; - viewfinders VF-P116WE and VF-PSSOWE  which can be connected to the abovementioned new camera head KY-D29WECH and which are successor models of the viewfinders VF-P116  respectively VF-P550BE  already included in the Annex; All above models are sold without a corresponding triax system or triax adaptor; 3. Findings (9) The Commission carried out a technical examination including a detailed comparison of the models concerned with their predecessor models listed in the Annex and found that they were almost completely identical. The small differences found are the result of the technical development in the TCS sector but did not affect the classification of these TCS as professional camera systems. Therefore  it was concluded that all models concerned should be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures. (10) The Commission informed the Community producers and the exporters of TCS of its findings and provided them with an opportunity to present their views. On this basis and in the light of the fact that the interested parties did not object to the Commission's conclusions  all models and related equipment listed in recital (8) are professional camera systems. It follows that they should be exempted from the application of the anti-dumping duty applicable to certain television camera systems originating in Japan  and that the Annex should be amended accordingly ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

838,31.10.2014 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 311/75 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION of 29 October 2014 rejecting the refusal of the authorisation of a biocidal product notified by Germany in accordance with Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (notified under document C(2014) 7915) (Text with EEA relevance) (2014/758/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1)  and in particular Article 36(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) contained the list of active substances approved at Union level for inclusion in biocidal products. Commission Directives 2008/78/EC (3)  2008/79/EC (4) and 2008/86/EC (5) added the active substances propiconazole  IPBC and tebuconazole  respectively  for use in products belonging to product-type 8  wood preservatives  as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC. By virtue of Article 86 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012  these substances are therefore approved active substances included in the list referred to in Article 9(2) of that Regulation. (2) In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 98/8/EC  the company Arch Timber Protection Ltd submitted on 2 April 2010 an application to The United Kingdom for authorisation of a wood preservative biocidal product containing propiconazole  IPBC and tebuconazole (‘the contested product’). The United Kingdom authorised the contested product on 7 June 2012 for industrial use and temporary protection of freshly sawn/felled wood and unseasoned timber only  also indicating that wood treated with this product can be used for Use Classes 2 and 3 as described in the Technical Notes for Guidance on Product Evaluation (6). The product consists of two packs to be mixed and diluted at industrial premises depending on site-specific application conditions by dipping or enclosed deluge. Ten Member States have subsequently authorised the contested product through mutual recognition. (3) Arch Timber Protection Ltd (‘the applicant’) submitted on 16 July 2012 a complete application to Germany for mutual recognition of the authorisation of the contested product granted by the United Kingdom. (4) Germany notified the Commission  the other Member States and the applicant on 19 August 2013 of its proposal to refuse the authorisation in accordance with Article 4(4) of Directive 98/8/EC. Germany considered that the contested product does not meet the requirements of Article 5(1) of Directive 98/8/EC with regard to the environment. (5) According to Germany  the authorisation did not reflect well that the product was intended for temporary wood protection and the product was not appropriately assessed by the United Kingdom in terms of environmental risks. The assessment performed by Germany concluded in an unacceptable risk for the environment at day 30 following the application of the product (‘time 1’)  which also raised concerns regarding the potential use of wood treated with the contested product under Use Classes 2 and 3 conditions. (6) Germany also considered that  since the ratio of the active substances and non-active substances in the working solutions of the product is variable  the product does not meet the definition of biocidal products in Article 2(a) of Directive 98/8/EC and should have been authorised as a frame formulation as defined by Article 2(j) of Directive 98/8/EC. (7) The Commission invited other Member States and the applicant to submit comments to the notification in writing within 90 days in accordance with Article 27(1) of Directive 98/8/EC. Comments were submitted within that deadline by Germany  The United Kingdom and the applicant. The notification was also discussed on 24 September 2013 in the meeting of the coordination group established under Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. (8) With regard to the risks for the environment  from those discussions and comments it follows that the evaluation carried out by the United Kingdom  in the absence of an agreed model for temporary wood protection  followed the best guidance available at the time (7)  which is based on models for treated wood to be placed on the market under Use Classes 2 and 3 conditions. The assessment was also based on a worst-case assumption of a complete release of the active substances at time 1. (9) It also follows that the evaluation performed by the United Kingdom following those models is compatible with current guidance (8). Where a risk is identified at time 1 as a result of a worst-case assumption  safe use of treated wood under Use Classes 2 and 3 conditions can be assumed when the risk for the environment at the end of the service life is considered acceptable. (10) The Commission also notes that cases where an unacceptable risk is identified at time 1 are currently under discussion at Union level in order to establish a harmonised approach. Against this background the Commission considers that  until such an approach is formally adopted  the conclusions of the assessment of the contested product by the United Kingdom should be considered as valid until the renewal of the product authorisation. (11) With regard to the identity of the product  from those discussions and comments it follows that the contested product  in the form in which it is supplied to the industrial users  has specific fixed concentrations of the active and non-active substances. The Commission considers that the fact that industrial users can prepare different solutions of the product at the work place  which are process dependant  cannot be interpreted in a way as if the authorisation holder was placing on the market a group of different biocidal products as referred to in Article 2(j) of Directive 98/8/EC. (12) In the light of those arguments  the Commission supports the conclusions of the evaluation carried out by the United Kingdom and the other Member States having approved the product through mutual recognition  considering that the contested product meets the definition in Article 2(a) of Directive 98/8/EC and fulfils the requirements set by Article 5(1) of that Directive with regard to the environment. The Commission therefore considers that the request by Germany to refuse the authorisation cannot be justified on the grounds put forward. (13) Finally  on the basis of the discussions held  it appears necessary to explicitly mention in the product authorisation that the use of the product is for temporary wood protection and to ensure  as a condition for the authorisation  that specific instructions for use of the product are provided to industrial users taking into consideration the characteristics of the industrial sites where the product is to be used. (14) Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 applies to the contested product in accordance with the provisions of Article 92(2) of that Regulation. Since the legal basis for this Decision is Article 36(3) of that Regulation  this decision should be addressed to all Member States by virtue of Article 36(4) of that Regulation.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) On 31 August 1996  the Commission announced  by two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities  the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding(4) as well as an anti-subsidy proceeding(5) in respect of imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. (2) The Commission sought and verified all informaton that it deemed necessary for the purpose of its definitive findings. As a result of this examination  it was established that definitive anti-dumping and countervailing measures should be adopted in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation. All interested parties were informed of the results of the investigation and were given the opportunity to comment thereon. (3) On 26 September 1997  the Commission adopted Decision 97/634/EC(6)  accepting undertakings offered in connection with the two above-mentioned proceedings from the exporters listed in the Annex to the Decision and terminating the investigations in their respect. (4) On the same day  the Council  by Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(7) and (EC) No 1891/97(8) imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. Imports of farmed Atlantic salmon exported by companies from which an undertaking had been accepted were exempted from that duty pursuant to Article 1(2) of those Regulations. (5) The above-mentioned Regulations set out the definitive findings and conclusions on all aspects of the investigations. The form of the duties having been reviewed  Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 were replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(9). B. OBLIGATIONS OF EXPORTERS WITH UNDERTAKINGS (6) The text of the undertakings provides that failure to submit a quarterly report of all sales transactions to the first unrelated customer in the Community within a prescribed time-limit would  except in case of force majeure  be construed as a violation of the undertaking. (7) For the fourth quarter of 1999  one Norwegian company  Fryseriet AS  failed to present such a sales report within the prescribed time limit  despite a reminder sent to it 24 hours before the quaterly deadline. The company was subsequently given an opportunity to inform the Commission of any reasons which may have prevented its report from being received within the time limit  however  no reply was received. (8) Fryseriet AS was then sent disclosure in writing concerning the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties against it. The company was also given an opportunity to submit comments and request a hearing  however  as before  it did not react. (9) In view of the above  it is considered necessary to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking offered by Fryseriet AS and to impose definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties against it. Accordingly  the name of this company should be deleted from the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC which lists the companies from which undertakings are accepted. (10) In parallel to this Decision  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1783/2000(10)  has also withdrawn the exemption from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties granted to this company. C. NEW EXPORTERS (11) Following the original imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties  several Norwegian companies have made themselves known to the Commission claiming to be new exporters and requested  in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 in conjuction with Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 that the exemption to the duties be extended to them. (12) In this regard  five such exporters  Emborg Foods Norge AS  Helle Mat AS  Norsea Food AS  Salmon Company Fjord Norway AS and Stella Polaris AS demonstrated that they had not exported the product concerned to the Community during the investigation period which led to the current anti-dumping and countervailing duties (""the original investigation period""). (13) These companies also showed that they are not related to any of the companies in Norway which are subject to anti-dumping and countervailing duties. In addition  they provided evidence of exports of the product concerned to the Community after the original investigation period  or proof that they had entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant amount of the product concerned to the Community. (14) The companies concerned have offered undertakings which are identical to those previously offered by other Norwegian companies exporting farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. By doing so  they have all agreed to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community. (15) Since undertakings on such terms can be monitored effectively by the Commission  and their acceptance would eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation  the offers are considered acceptable. (16) The companies concerned have been informed of the essential facts  considerations and obligations upon which acceptance of the undertakings given by them are based. (17) Their names should therefore be added to the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. D. CHANGE OF NAME (18) Two other Norwegian exporters with undertakings  Agnefest AS and Norway Seafoods ASA advised the Commission that the names of the companies have changed to Rosfjord Seafood AS and Frionor AS respectively. The Commission has therefore verified and confirmed that there were no changes to the corporate structure which warranted a more detailed examination of the appropriateness of the companies maintaining their undertakings. (19) Accordingly  the names of these companies should be amended in the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. E. CESSATION OF TRADING BY A NORWEGIAN COMPANY (20) The Commission has also been advised that another Norwegian company from which an undertaking was accepted  Atlantic King Stranda A/S  has ceased to trade and has been wound up. Accordingly  the name of this company should be deleted from the list of companies in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO DECISION 97/634/EC (21) The Advisory Committee has been consulted on all of the above changes and amendments to Decision 97/634/EC and has raised no objections. (22) For the sake of clarity  however  an updated version of Annex to Decision 97/634/EC should be published herewith  showing the exporters whose undertakings are currently in force.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005  where applications for import rights exceed 5 % of the quantity available under the quota  the excess has to be disregarded. It is appropriate to delete that provision in order to align the provisions in Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 to those in Article 6(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006. (3) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 provides that  following the notification by the Member States of the quantities applied for import rights  the Commission has to decide as soon as possible to which extent those applications can be met. Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 provides that an allocation coefficient should only be fixed in cases where the quantities covered by applications exceed the quantities available for the import tariff quota period. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 being a horizontal Regulation  the current provision of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 should therefore be deleted. Moreover  it is necessary to lay down the time period within which import rights should be awarded. (4) For cases where such allocation coefficient is fixed  it is necessary to specify that the securities lodged together with the applications for import rights under Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 should then be released proportionally. (5) The second subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 provides that each issuing of an import licence has to result in a corresponding reduction of the import rights obtained. It is appropriate to specify that when issuing an import licence the security lodged together with the application for import rights should then be released proportionally. (6) Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

881,COMMISSION DECISION of 8 December 1998 concerning applications submitted by Rubycon UK for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of certain large electrolytic aluminium capacitors originating in Japan (notified under document number C(1998) 3542) (Only the English text is authentic) (98/730/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2)  and in particular Article 11(8) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3482/92 (3) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of large electrolytic aluminium capacitors with a CV product (capacitance multiplied by rated voltage) between 18 000 and 310 000 micro-coulombs at a voltage of 160 V or more  and with a diameter of 19mm or more and a length of 20 mm or more (hereinafter referred to as LAECs) originating in Japan. The rate of definitive duty applicable to imports of the product manufactured by Rubycon Corporation  Ina Nagano (hereinafter referred to as Rubycon Japan) was set at 30 1 %. This was the level of duty in force in respect of the imports for which a refund is claimed. (2) On 28 August 1996 Rubycon Japan submitted a request for an interim review (hereinafter referred to as the review) which was initiated on 17 December 1996 by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4). The Commission sought and verified all the information it considered necessary and made verification visits to the premises of Rubycon Japan and of its subsidiary in the United Kingdom  Rubycon UK within the framework of the review which covered the period from 1 October 1995 to 30 September 1996. The review was concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 2593/97 (5) which determined that the dumping margin of Rubycon Japan for the product concerned during the investigation period was 4 2 % and reduced the anti-dumping duty accordingly. (3) On 28 August 1996 and 3 February 1997 Rubycon Japan's subsidiary in the United Kingdom (hereinafter referred to as the applicant) submitted applications for the refund of GBP [ . . . ] (6) (57 transactions in total). The refund claim corresponds to anti-dumping duties paid on imports of LAECs originating in Japan released for free circulation in the United Kingdom in the period from 26 February 1996 to 3 December 1996. The goods for which a refund is claimed were invoiced by Rubycon Japan between 19 January 1996 and 25 October 1996. (4) The applicant received disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to adopt this Decision. The applicant made no comment. (5) Since the merits of the refund applications which are within the scope of this Decision as defined in recital 7 are dependent in their entirety on the findings of the review  the applications should be considered to be duly substantiated by evidence within the meaning of the fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the Basic Regulation) from the date on which the findings of the review were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities  that is 23 December 1997. B. ARGUMENTS OF THE APPLICANT (6) The applicant claims that the dumping margin in respect of the LAECs released into free circulation in the Community during the period from 26 February 1996 to 3 December 1996 for which anti-dumping duties were paid was significantly lower than the applicable duty rate of 30 1 %. C. SCOPE OF THIS DECISION (7) The applications in respect of 52 transactions on which anti-dumping duties of GBP [ . . . ] were paid relate to invoices issued within the investigation period set for that review (that is from 1 October 1995 to 30 September 1996). Since these transactions fall within the investigation period of the review  the merits of the refund applications should be established on the basis of the results of the review investigation in accordance with the fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation. (8) This Decision does not concern itself with the applications in respect of the remaining five transactions totalling GBP [ . . . ] of anti-dumping duties. These will be dealt with by another Decision following the conclusions of a separate review  not yet concluded  which was initiated on 3 December 1997 by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (7) further to a request from the Federation for Appropriate Remedial Anti-Dumping (FARAD). D. ADMISSIBILITY (9) The applications are inadmissible in respect of two import transactions totalling GBP [ . . . ] of anti-dumping duties because the time-limit of six months prescribed by the Basic Regulation between the determination of duties to be levied and the submission of the applications for refund was not respected with regard to those two transactions. (10) The applications in respect of the other transactions should be considered as admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Basic Regulation  in particular in respect of time limits. E. MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS (11) The Commission considers that the information and findings of the review  whose investigation covered the period from 1 October 1995 to 30 September 1996  should be used in this instance in accordance with the fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation  to determine whether and to what extent a refund is justified for the import transactions which were invoiced by Rubycon Japan between 1 October 1995 and 30 September 1996 (see recital 7). (12) As mentioned above  the review determined that the dumping margin for the product concerned exported by Rubycon Japan in the period of investigation was 4 2 %. As a result of the comparison with the duty applied  an amount of GBP [ . . . ] is refundable to the applicant and the application should be rejected in so far as concerns the remaining GBP [ . . . ] ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market or on the Community import market for the product. (3) Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as regards import duties in the rice sector. (4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. They also remain in force in cases where no quotation is available from the source referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 during the two weeks preceding the next periodical fixing. (5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally  the market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties. (6) Application of the second subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 results in an adjustment of the import duties that have been fixed as from 24 June 2004 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1157/2004 (3) as set out in the Annexes to this Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

whereas  therefore  Portugal should be permitted to dispatch such material from its territory to other Member States for incineration; whereas it is necessary to lay down appropriate guarantees for the controls at the place of destination; (4) Whereas the prohibition on the dispatch from Portugal of bovine products was to apply only until 1 August 1999  provided that a risk assessment conducted on the basis of the findings of a mission of the Food and Veterinary Office  taking into account the evolution of the disease  demonstrates that appropriate measures have been taken to manage any risk  and that the relevant Community and national measures are complied with and effectively enforced; (5) Whereas at the General Session of the World Organisation for Animal Health (International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE)) Committee from 17 to 21 May 1999  a proposal of the OIE International Animal Health Code Commission concerning the criteria for the determination of the BSE status of a country or zone was adopted; whereas according to those criteria  a country or zone will be classified as having a high incidence of BSE if the BSE incidence rate  calculated over the past 12 months  has been greater than 100 cases per 1000000 within the cattle population over 24 months of age in the country or zone; whereas the current BSE incidence rate in Portugal calculated over the past 12 months per 1000000 animals over 24 months of age is 211; whereas  therefore  Portugal is to be classified as having a high incidence of BSE; whereas Article 3.2.13.9 of that Code recommends conditions for the import of deboned meat and meat products from cattle from a country or zone with a high incidence of BSE; whereas Portugal cannot provide guarantees that those conditions are met; (6) Whereas missions on BSE related issues have been carried out in Portugal by the Food and Veterinary Office from 22 February to 3 March 1999 and from 19 to 23 April 1999; whereas those missions contributed to the assessment of the application and effectiveness of measures to protect against BSE; whereas those missions concluded that serious efforts and considerable progress had been made in the implementation of risk management measures in a short period  despite not all measures being adequately enforced; (7) Whereas in those circumstances  it is appropriate to maintain the prohibition on the dispatch of bovine products; (8) Whereas Council Directive 89/608/EEC of 21 November 1989 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of legislation on veterinary and zootechnical matters(6)  and in particular Article 10 thereof  lays down the rules for the communication by the competent authorities in the Member States to the Commission of information on operations  which are  or appear to be  contrary to Decision 98/653/EC and which are of particular interest at Community level; (9) Whereas Directive 89/662/EEC requires the Member State of destination to take appropriate measures in case of irregularities; whereas protocols should be laid down for such measures in the Member States of destination; (10) Whereas Decision 98/653/EC should be amended accordingly; (11) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.

The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 14569 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 409/2001(5) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

(2) Imports of fresh meat from South Africa are only possible from a part of the territory of this country which has been recognised by the European Community as officially free of foot-and-mouth disease. (3) On 15 September 2000 the competent authorities confirmed on outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the province of KwaZulu-Natal  in the free region. (4) The situation is liable to seriously endanger Community livestock in view of imports of products of biungulate animals.

(6) It is therefore necessary to redefine the territory of South Africa from which imports into the Community of fresh meat are authorised. (7) In addition  it appears necessary to clarify  that imports of fresh meat from Namibia are only possible from the territory South of the cordon fences which extend from Palgrave Point in the west to Gam in the east  which has bene recognised by the European Community as officially free of foot-and-mouth disease.

(4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) However  in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets  allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.

This provision was reproduced in Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1466/95 of 27 June 1995 laying down special detailed rules of application for export refunds on milk and milk products(5)  which repeals Regulation (EEC) No 2729/81.

Regulation (EEC) No 2730/81 has therefore become devoid of purpose and may be repealed. (2) Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2931/79 provides that when agricultural products are exported which may  under agreements concluded by the Community  qualify for special treatment on importation into a third country if certain conditions are met  the competent authorities of the Member States will  on request and after appropriate checks are made  issue a document certifying that the conditions have been met. In accordance with that Regulation  Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3305/82 of 9 December 1982 laying down detailed rules for the provision of administrative assistance in connection with the export of cheeses eligible for special treatment on import into Norway(7) requires exporters to present a certificate attesting to the Community origin of the cheeses exported. Paragraph 4(1) of Annex IV to the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway concerning certain arrangements in agriculture(8) provides that products will benefit from the Agreement upon submission of either a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice. Regulation (EEC) No 3305/82 may therefore be repealed since the presentation of the certificate referred to in Article 1 thereof is no longer required. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3439/83 of 5 December 1983 laying down special conditions for the export of certain cheeses to Australia(9) provides for a special certificate to be presented to the authorities of that country attesting that the Community cheeses imported have benefitted from a lower refund than those set for other destinations. With the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1776/96 of 12 September 1996 fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products(10) refunds for cheeses exported to Australia are no longer fixed and consequently Regulation (EEC) No 3439/83 has become devoid of purpose and may be repealed.

PROCEDURE 1. Measures in force (1) In February 1998  by Regulation (EC) No 368/98(2)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of glyphosate originating in the People's Republic of China. The rate of the definitive duty applicable to the net  free-at-Community-frontier price  amounted to 24 0 %. 2. Request for a review (2) On 19 June 1998  a request for a review of the abovementioned measures was lodged pursuant to Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the ""basic Regulation""). The lodging was made on behalf of the Community producers whose collective output of glyphosate constituted a major proportion of the total Community production of that product within the meaning of Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation  namely Cheminova Agro (Denmark)  Monsanto Europe (Belgium) and Zeneca Agrochemicals (United Kingdom). (3) In the request  it was alleged that the abovementioned anti-dumping measures had led to no movement  or insufficient movement  in resale prices or subsequent selling prices in the Community. To this effect  the complainants submitted sufficient evidence showing that export prices had actually fallen following the imposition of the said measures which had made no impact on resale and subsequent selling prices in the Community. B. REVIEW INVESTIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 12 OF THE BASIC REGULATION 1. Initiation of the review pursuant to Article 12 (4) On 6 August 1998  the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) the initiation of a review  pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation  of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of glyphosate originating in the People's Republic of China  and commenced an investigation. (5) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producers  of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (6) The Commission services sent questionnaires to all exporters known to be concerned  namely: Beixi City Chemical Plant  Beixi (Liaoning); Shanghai Union Chemical  Shanghai; Panyu Chemical Factory  Panyu (Guangzhou); Samning City Pesticide Factory  Sanming City (Fujian); Zhangjiagang No 2 Pesticide  Jiangsu; Haiyan Pesticide Factory  Haiyan (Zhejiang); Guangzhou Pesticide Factory  Guangzhou; Hainan Pesticide Factory  Haikou City (Hainan); Anyang Pesticide Factory  Anyang (Henan); Taixin Huangqiao Chemical Factory  Sanliu Bridge Village (Jiangsu); Nantong Chemical Plant  Nantong (Jiangsu); Suzhou Chemical &  Pesticide  Suzhou (Jiangsu); Taichung Pesticide Factory  Taichung (Jiangsu); Wujin Pesticide Factory  Changzhou City (Jiangsu); Chuan Xi Chemical Plant  Deyang City (Sichuan); Shifang Chemical Group Pesticide Factory  Shuangsheng (Sichuan); Longyou Pesticide Factory  Longyou Town (Zhejiang); Ningbo No 2 Chemical Plant  Ningbo (Zhejiang); CAC Chemical Co. Ltd  Shanghai; Fujian Sannong Chemistry Co. Ltd  Xubi-Sanming (Fujian); Zhangjiagang No 2 Pesticide Factory  Nansha Town (Jiangsu); Tide International Co. Ltd  Hangzhou; Sinochem Ningbo Imp &  Exp Corp.  Ningbo; Sinochem Jiangsu Imp &  Exp Corp.  Nanjing; Sinochem Heilongjiang Imp &  Exp Corp.  Harbin; Sinochem International Chemicals Co.  Beijing; Sinochem Liaoning Imp &  Exp Corp.  Dalian; Sinochem Tianjin Imp &  Exp Corp.  Tianjin; Hubei Sanonda Co. Ltd  Shashi (Hubei); Shenjen Jiangshan Commerce &  Industrial Group  Shenzhou; China International Trust Investment Corp. (""CITIC"")  Beijing; Quickett  Hong Kong; High Kite Ltd  Hong Kong  and Rotam  Hong Kong. (7) No replies to the questionnaire were received from the abovementioned exporters and producers except for Fujian Sannong Chemistry Co. Ltd and Jiangsu Zhejiang Jiangnan Chemical Factory  which reported no exports to the Community during the new investigation period (as defined in recital 10)  Hubei Sanonda Co. Ltd  which reported having stopped producing glyphosate since the year 1997  and Zhenjiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Co. Ltd which claimed that it was one of the largest Chinese manufacturers and exporters of glyphosate to the Community during the investigation period. (8) On 23 September 1999  the sole cooperating exporter  Zhenjiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Co. Ltd requested individual treatment and submitted some information to support its claim. The Commission deemed such information insufficient and sent a specific individual treatment questionnaire to the Chinese company concerned. No reply was made to this questionnaire. (9) Questionnaires were also sent to independent importers known to have imported glyphosate from the People's Republic of China so as to ascertain the resale prices of the product concerned before and after the imposition of the anti-dumping duties. Replies to the questionnaires were received from the following unrelated importers: - Feinchemie Schwebda GmbH  Germany  - Herbex Produtos QuĂ­micos SA  Portugal  - Industrias Afrasa SA  Spain  and - Calliope SA  France. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the abovementioned unrelated importers. (10) The investigation period of this review runs from 1 January 1998 to 30 June 1998. This investigation period was used to determine the current level of export prices and resale and subsequent selling prices charged after the imposition of anti-dumping measures to see whether the measures had achieved the intended effects in terms of increased import prices for the product under consideration. (11) In establishing whether resale and subsequent selling prices had moved sufficiently  the price levels charged in the investigation period were compared to those charged during the original investigation period which had covered the period from 1 September 1994 to 31 August 1995. (12) Owing to the volume of data gathered and examined  in particular in view of the complexity of the analysis of the movement of the resale and subsequent selling prices  and the fact that normal values were re-examined  the investigation exceeded the normal period of six months provided for in Article 12(4) of the basic Regulation. 2. Product concerned (13) The product concerned by the request  and for which the review was initiated  is the same as in the original investigation  i.e. glyphosate currently classifiable within CN codes ex29310095 (2931 00 80 until 31 December 1997) and ex38083027  the latter when put up in forms or packing for retail use or as preparations or articles. (14) Glyphosate is a herbicide which can be produced in different grades or forms of concentration: formulated (with 36 % glyphosate content)  salt (with 62 %)  cake (with 84 %) and acid (with 95 %). In order to reduce the costs of transportation  distributors normally purchase glyphosate in a concentrated form (usually acid  but also salt) which they subsequently dilute to obtain the formulated glyphosate  the only form that can be used as an end product. 3. Movement of export prices from China and of resale prices in the community (a) Introduction (15) The purpose of this investigation is to establish whether measures have had the intended remedial effects in removing injury and whether any such failure to remove injury is as a result of increased dumping through a fall in export prices. For the purpose of the present proceeding  such a fall in export prices may be reflected in the direct export prices charged by exporters to the Community or it may be reflected in a lack of movement in resale prices or subsequent selling prices in the Community due to a compensatory arrangement. Therefore  the investigation examined price movements of export prices from China as well as prices at resale and other levels in the Community. (b) Movement in export prices from China (16) The Commission sought information on the export prices of glyphosate from China. Information was provided by the one cooperating Chinese exporter and four cooperating unrelated importers in the Community. In fact  export prices were found to have fallen by approximately 45 % as compared to those that were established during the original investigation. (c) Movement in resale prices in the Community (17) The Commission sought information on resale prices and subsequent selling prices of glyphosate in the Community before and after the imposition of anti-dumping measures. The four cooperating unrelated importers in the Community  who imported the product concerned during the investigation period  provided information on import and resale prices of Chinese glyphosate. (18) A comparison of resale prices charged during the original investigation period and those charged during the present investigation period showed that resale prices had actually fallen since measures were imposed. On average this fall amounted to approximately 12 % as compared to the level previously established in the original investigation. The unrelated importers did not provide evidence that this fall was due to the increased efficiency of their resale operations in the Community. 4. Claims made by interested parties (a) General (19) In Article 12 investigations  importers and exporters are provided with an opportunity to provide evidence which could justify a lack of movement in prices in the Community following the imposition of measures. The reasons which can justify such a lack of movement include a reduction in the costs and profit of the importer or a fall in normal value. Several parties provided information in this respect. (b) Producers/exporters in the country of origin (20) One Chinese producer/exporter of glyphosate argued that the fall in resale prices since the imposition of anti-dumping measures was mainly caused by a worldwide decline in the cost of production of glyphosate  which in its turn was reflected in significant changes of normal values which ought to be taken into account. (21) Since the normal value established during the original investigation was established on the basis of an analogue country  i.e. Brazil  the Commission requested information in respect of normal values from the two known Brazilian producers which cooperated during the original investigation  i.e. Monsanto Brasil and Nortox  which continue to be the sole producers of glyphosate in the analogue country. Investigations were carried out at the premises of the Brazilian producers. (22) The Commission verified normal values and found that they had indeed fallen. This fall  which was calculated in relation to the normal values of the original case and those prevailing in the investigation period of this case  showed a fall of 17 %. However  as export prices had fallen by a far greater amount (45 %) the movement in normal values could not justify the lack of movement in resale prices in the Community. (c) Unrelated importers in the Community (23) The Commission also examined whether the lack of movement of resale prices was due to a decrease in the costs and profits of the unrelated importers. In this respect  the position of the four cooperating importers was examined and it was found that the levels of their costs and profits had remained broadly the same as those found in the original case. Therefore  these claims were rejected. 5. Reassessment of the export prices (24) Normally  in Article 12 investigations where a lack of movement of resale prices has been established  export prices would be reassessed on the basis of prices charged to independent buyers in the Community by the importer from which all costs and a normal profit of the said importer would be deducted to arrive at a constructed export price. This would be done in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. (25) In this case  however  the reassessment of export prices was made by reference to the fall in the direct export prices charged between the exporters and importers in accordance with the last sentence of Article 12(2) of the basic Regulation. This direct fall in export prices was considered to be the reason for the lack of movement in resale prices and subsequent selling prices in the Community following the imposition of measures and therefore the absorption of measures is reflected in the fall in export prices. (26) As export prices were found to have fallen by 45 % since the existing measures were imposed  the reassessed export prices were established by taking the export prices found in the original investigation and deducting the amount of the anti-dumping duty in force. 6. Recalculation of the dumping margin taking account of reassessed export prices (27) As required under Article 12 of the basic Regulation  the Commission recalculated the dumping margin for the Chinese producers/exporters concerned. This was done by comparing the reassessed export prices with the normal values established during the original investigation. This gives a dumping margin which when expressed as a percentage of the cif value equates to 62 %. Pursuant to Article 12(3) of the basic Regulation  the measures in force shall therefore be amended in accordance with the new findings. 7. New level of duties (28) The measures currently in force are based on the level of injury found in the original investigation. Therefore  the reassessed export prices were compared with the injury threshold established in the original investigation. Since the injury margin calculated on this basis is lower than the dumping margin  the new level of the duty should be based in the former. Accordingly  the proposed level of duty expressed as a percentage of the cif value is 48 % ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROCEDURE (1) On 24 October 2000 the Commission received a complaint pursuant to Article 3 and Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 (hereafter the ""Regulation""). The complaint was lodged by the Committee of European Union Shipbuilders Associations (CESA). (2) The complaint concerned certain alleged Korean trade practices which adversely affect Community sales of commercial vessels(3). In particular  the complaint contained information on adverse trade effects and injury suffered by Community shipbuilders resulting from subsidies granted to  or otherwise benefiting  Korean shipbuilding companies by the Republic of Korea in violation of Articles 3 and 5 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). On that basis  the complainant asked the Commission to take the necessary action. (3) The complaint contained sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a Community examination procedure pursuant to Article 8 of the Regulation. Consequently  the Commission initiated the procedure after consulting with the Member States in the framework of the Advisory Committee  on 2 December 2000(4). (4) Following the initiation of the examination procedure the Commission carried out an investigation  which has led to the conclusions indicated below. B. FINDINGS REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBSTACLE TO TRADE (5) The investigation was directed against subsidies allegedly granted by the Government of the Republic of Korea to its shipbuilding industry that benefited production between 1997 and 2000 and will benefit future production. Alleged Korean subsidies have included  export contingent financing  debt forgiveness  debt-for-equity-swaps  interest relief and special tax concessions in the context of preferential restructuring packages provided in order to save various shipbuilding enterprises from imminent financial collapse. (6) The Korean shipbuilding enterprises claimed to have benefited from Korean Government subsidies included Samho Heavy Industries  Daedong Shipbuilding Co.  Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering  Hyundai Heavy Industries  Hyundai Mipo  Samsung Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries &  Construction Co. (7) With regard to the alleged Korean subsidies that were expressly the subject of the complaint the Commission established the following: Advance payment (refund) guarantees and pre-shipment loans provided by the State-owned Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) (8) It was established that KEXIM provides a guarantee that a foreign buyer will be refunded any advance payments given to a Korean shipyard in case the Korean shipyard fails to perform its obligations under the relevant contract. It was also established that KEXIM provides pre-delivery loans to shipyards to finance shipbuilding production costs  such as raw material cost  labour and overheads until delivery of the ships. The APRG programme and the pre-shipment loans were found to constitute prohibited subsidies under Article 3(1)(a) of the SCM Agreement. Debt forgiveness  debt-for-equity-swaps and interest relief by government-owned and government-controlled banks (9) It was established that Korea has granted through debt forgiveness  debt-for-equity-swaps and interest relief by government-owned and government-controlled banks  subsidies within the meaning of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement to the following shipyards: - Samho Heavy Industries  - Daedong Shipbuilding Co.(5) and - Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering. (10) There is prima facie evidence that these corporate restructuring subsidies are specific within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the SCM Agreement. Special tax concessions (11) It was established that Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering has benefited from two tax programmes under the Special Tax Treatment Control Law (special taxation on in-kind contribution and special taxation on spin-off) limited to companies under corporate restructuring which are therefore specific. Conclusion (12) The Commission considers that the complainant's allegation on the granting of subsidies is well-founded and that the Korean practices constitute an obstacle to trade within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation  as they are contrary to Articles 3 and 5 of the SCM Agreement. C. FINDINGS REGARDING ADVERSE TRADE EFFECTS (13) It was established that  during the investigation period  the Community industry suffered adverse effects within the meaning of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement and Article 2(3) and Article 2(4) of the Regulation  in the form of injury within the meaning of Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement  namely  negative effects on market share  capacity utilisation  profit  sales prices  employment  investments  and of serious prejudice within the meaning of Article 5(c) of the SCM Agreement  namely  significant price undercutting  price depression and lost sales. By sector  adverse effects were suffered in container ships and product and chemical tankers. (14) In November 2001  CESA requested the Commission to examine whether adverse effects had been suffered by the Community industry during the period covering the 13 months following the end of the original investigation period (i.e. 1 December 2000 to 31 December 2001). The updating investigation confirmed the findings of the first investigation. As regards the liquified natural gas carriers (LNG) sector  it established that further examination is necessary to determine whether the developments observed in 2000 and 2001 would result in a consistent trend over a longer term. The Commission will continue to monitor the market  particularly as regards the sectors of container ships  product and chemical tankers and LNG carriers. D. CAUSAL LINK (15) It was established that the above subsidies  which rendered possible the increase in sales volume and market share of the Korean shipyards as well as the considerable decrease in their sales prices and the price undercutting found during the investigation period  caused adverse effects to the Community industry. These conclusions were confirmed by the updating investigation. E. COMMUNITY INTEREST (16) The shipbuilding industry in the Community represents a very important sector of economic activity in terms of employment  either direct  in the shipyards or indirect  in subcontracting or supplying companies. On the basis of the information available it seems reasonable to forecast that  should the Korean subsidy practices be halted  the Community industry may be able to regain at least part of its lost market shares and improve its profitability. F. CONCLUSIONS (17) Further to the above analysis  the Commission concludes that Korea has granted export and actionable subsidies within the meaning of the SCM Agreement to its shipbuilding industry and has caused adverse effects to the Community industry. (18) Ensuring that WTO partners fully comply with their obligations is of the utmost importance for the Community  which has committed itself to the same obligations. It is fundamental for the good functioning of a multilateral trade system to consistently tackle allegedly WTO incompatible practices. (19) The Commission discussed the matter with the Korean authorities with a view to finding a mutually agreed solution. However  as no mutually agreed solution could be found  the initiation of a procedure within the framework of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding  and more particularly pursuant to the relevant provisions of the SCM Agreement  is required ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 (2) lays down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide content of wine in particular. Under Article 19(4) thereof  Annex XIIa to that Regulation lists the cases where the Member States may authorise an increase in the maximum total sulphur dioxide content of wine of less than 300 milligrams per litre by a maximum of 40 milligrams per litre because of weather conditions. (3) By letter of 1 March 2007  the French Government requested authorisation to increase the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide content of wine of less than 300 milligrams per litre by a maximum of 40 milligrams per litre for wine produced in the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin regions from the 2006 grape harvest in the wake of exceptionally unfavourable weather conditions. That request should be acceded to. (4) The technical note provided by the competent French authorities shows that the quantities of sulphur dioxide needed to ensure the proper vinification and proper preservation of the wines affected by these unfavourable conditions and to ensure that they are suitable for placing on the market should be increased above the level normally authorised. This temporary measure is the only available option to allow the grapes affected by these unfavourable weather conditions to be used to produce wine suitable for placing on the market. Following measures taken by the French Institute of Winemaking Technology  it has been estimated that approximately 25 % of the total quantity produced in this area is likely to be affected by this derogation.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kg for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (5) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.

969,COMMISSION DECISION of 30 January 1997 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Spain of certain Portland cement originating in Romania  Tunisia and Turkey (97/169/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  and in particular Article 9 thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (2)  hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`  and in particular Article 9 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) In January 1992  the Commission received a complaint lodged by Oficemen  the national organization of Spanish cement producers acting on behalf of all Spanish producers of Portland cement. (2) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping on a regional basis and of injury resulting therefrom. The evidence presented was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding in order to establish whether the facts alleged existed and justified any action being taken. The Commission accordingly announced  by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3)  the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Spain of certain Portland cement originating in Turkey  Romania and Tunisia  and began an investigation. The product concerned is Portland cement  other than white  whether or not artificially coloured  in bulk or in bags  falling within CN code 2523 29 00. (3) The Commission officially advised the producers  exporters and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting countries  and the complainants  and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. (4) The Governments of Turkey and Tunisia  and the producers and exporters in the countries concerned made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested were granted a hearing. (5) The investigation period was set as 1 April 1991 to 31 March 1992. (6) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of its determination of dumping and injury and carried out investigations at the premises of the following Spanish producers: - Asland Cataluna y del Mediterranneo  Barcelona  - Asland  SA  Madrid  - Cementos Atlantico  SA  Madrid  - Cementos Molins  SA  Barcelona  - Compania Valenciana de Cementos Portland  SA  Valencia  - Portland Iberia  SA  Madrid  - Sociedad Financiera y Minera  SA  Madrid  - Uniland Cementera  SA  Barcelona. (7) On the basis of the results of such investigation  the Commission  after consulting the Anti-dumping Committee  concluded that the proceeding should be terminated without measures because no material injury nor threat thereof was found to have been caused to the Spanish industry by the imports concerned. (8) The Commission  given the objections within the Advisory Committee  submitted  on 10 February 1994  in accordance with Article 9 of the Basic Regulation  a report to the Council together with a proposal that the proceeding be terminated without measures. The Council  on 7 March 1994  decided not to terminate the proceeding. (9) The Commission  following the Council's decision  re-examined the results of its investigation in the light of both information provided by the Spanish industry and verified during the investigation  and further representations from the complainants. In this respect  the scope of this re-examination was limited by the fact that it could only look at data from the investigation period and the information relating to a subsequent period can therefore not be taken into account. (10) This re-examination led the Commission to maintain the proposal made to the Council in 1994. B. LIKE PRODUCT (11) The investigation showed that the various types of Portland cement sold on the domestic markets of the countries concerned were alike to those exported to Spain. Similarly  the various types of Portland cement manufactured in Spain and those exported to Spain from the three countries in question were alike in their essential physical characteristics and end uses. Therefore  the Commission concluded that  for the purposes of this proceeding  all types of Portland cement should be considered as a like product  in accordance with Article 2 (12) of the Basic Regulation. C. REGIONALITY (12) The Commission established that 94 % of total production of the product in question by the Spanish industry was sold on the Spanish market and that total demand in Spain  as defined by apparent consumption of the cement concerned  was not to any substantial degree supplied by producers elsewhere in the Community. The share of their domestic market held by sales of the Spanish industry in the investigation period was close to 89 %  while imports from other Community Member States represented 2 %. Furthermore  89 % of total Community imports from the countries subject to this proceeding were imported into Spain. The Spanish industry could  therefore  be considered as constituting the Community industry within the terms of Article 4 (5) of the Basic Regulation. D. DUMPING (13) From the data available  there were indications that the like product imported from the three countries in question had been sold on the Spanish market at prices which  in some instances  represented a substantial element of dumping. This aspect was not pursued  however  given the findings on injury below. E. INJURY 1. Consumption  volume and market share of imports from the countries concerned. (14) The Spanish market  as defined by apparent consumption went from 26 million tonnes in 1989 to 28 million in the investigation period. Imports from the countries concerned grew from 857 000 tonnes in 1989 to 2 388 000 in the investigation period. As a result of this  the market share taken by Turkey  Romania and Tunisia went from 3 28 % in 1989 to 8 54 % in the investigation period. 2. Impact of the imports concerned on the Spanish industry. (15) With regard to the possible impact of the imports concerned on the situation of the Spanish industry  the Commission took account of the following facts: (a) Spanish production was stable at around 27 million tonnes annually over the period examined. (b) Capacity installed stood at an estimated 39 million tonnes in 1989  1990 and 1991  and grew by around 5 % to 41 million tonnes in the investigation period. Capacity utilization was stable at 69 % between 1989 and 1991  but fell to 66 % in the investigation period. This fall in the capacity utilization rate was due only to the increase in capacity installed. In this context  the Commission notes that  relative to total demand in Spain  a large over-capacity  averaging 32 %  existed in the Spanish industry throughout the period examined. (c) Total sales volumes of the Spanish industry remained stable at around 25 million tonnes throughout the period in question. Given the moderate rise in consumption  the market share of the industry  however  fell from 96 % in 1989 to 89 % in the investigation period. Despite this fall  the market share of the Spanish industry remained consistently high. (d) The selling prices to unrelated customers of the Spanish producers investigated  on an index basis  rose from 100 in 1989 to 103 in 1990  and then fell to 97 in 1991 and 94 in the investigation period. (e) The companies investigated saw profitability on sales to unrelated clients decline  on average  from 36 % in 1989  to 32 % in 1990  21 % in 1991  and to 18 % in the investigation period. (f) Employment by the producers investigated fell continuously over the period as a whole  moving  on an index basis from 100 in 1989  to 98 in 1990  94 in 1991  and 92 in the investigation period. (g) The Commission looked also into the possible injury caused by the imports concerned on a subregional basis  taking into account the different geographical locations of the Spanish producers. The Commission's examination of injury factors showed that only the situation of the producers based on the Mediterranean coastal zone  which represents 52 % of the total complainant industry's output  clearly deteriorated in contrast to that of producers located further inland. In fact  in terms of sales volume  between 1989 and the investigation period  coastal volumes fell by 10 % while inland increased by 3 %  and  in terms of turnover  coastal figure fell by 9 % while inland increased slightly by 1 %. Finally  with regard to the coastal industry  its profitability fell since 1989 by 4 percentage points more than for the inland industry. Despite this decrease  the profitability for the coastal industry remained at a level of 18 % during the investigation period. F. CONCLUSIONS ON INJURY (16) Although the situation of the Spanish industry deteriorated to some extent over the period considered  notably with regard to producers located on the Mediterranean coastal zone  such situation has to be assessed in relation to the Spanish producers generally  in order to determine whether these developments constitute material injury. In doing so  the Commission paid particular attention to the following factors: (a) Production and sales volumes were stable. Although the increase in consumption appeared to have benefited dumped imports and not domestic production  the Spanish industry nevertheless still retained a market share of 89 %. (b) The Commission's examination of price undercutting showed that  although undercutting did exist  its effects could not be considered significant  in the light of  on the one hand  the respective market shares held by domestic producers and by imports from the three countries concerned and  on the other hand  the impact of these imports  which was limited geographically to the coastal industry. (c) The large overcapacity and the consequent restructuring of the domestic industry played an important role in explaining the increase in costs of production and  therefore  the fall in profits. In this regard  Spanish producers did experience a reduction in their return on sales  which was however  still 18 % on average during the investigation period for the whole industry. Alternative profit indicators  such as return on investment  as suggested by the Spanish industry  have been examined. On the basis of the data provided by the complainant and verified to a satisfactory extent in the course of the investigation  it was found that  after taking into account inflationary cost pressures and eliminating the excess of capacity  the return on investment ratio established for the investigation period amounted to 7 % and was thus considered adequate for the replacement of productive assets by the industry. (d) Employment in the complainant industry fell by 8 % between 1989 and the investigation period. However  this fall was due  to a great extent  to the restructuring of the production process. On the basis of the above factors  it cannot be concluded that the Spanish industry has suffered material injury. This conclusion can be explained by the fact that the present proceeding refers to a regional market  as pointed out in recital (11) above. In such cases  Article 4 (5) of the Basic Regulation requires that injury is caused to the producers of all or almost all of the production within the regional market concerned. In the present proceeding  however  the Commission's examination of the individual producers investigated  on both inland and coastal areas  did not lead to the conclusion that this requirement was met. G. THREAT OF INJURY (17) The Commission considers that  although the complainant also alleged that a threat of material injury existed  no substantial evidence of such threat was presented by the complainant when the complaint was submitted  nor found in the course of the investigation. H. TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (18) In the absence of injury or threat thereof to the producers of all or almost all of the production within the regional market under consideration  a determination of material injury with regard to the Community industry concerned by the present proceeding cannot be made. In these circumstances  it is concluded that the introduction of protective measures appears to be unnecessary and the anti-dumping proceeding should be terminated ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

986,COMMISSION DECISION of 1 October 1997 concerning the extension of the 8 % investment premium for investment projects in the new Länder pursuant to the Finance Law 1996 (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (98/194/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular to Articles 92 and 93 thereof  Having given the other Member States and interested parties  pursuant to Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty  a period in which to submit their comments  Having regard to the comments submitted  Whereas: I By decision dated 11 November 1992 (1)  the Commission authorized an 8 % investment premium for investment projects in the new Länder begun before 1 July 1994 and completed before the end of 1996. The aid intensity of 8 % gross (approximately 5 2 % net) relates exclusively to the cost of acquiring assets for fixed investment. The investment premium is granted direct by Federal law  so that every undertaking which fulfils the statutory requirements can claim the premium without the authorities having to take a discretionary decision. The premium consists of a reduction of corporation tax and can result in a negative tax claim by the State  so that instead of a tax reduction the recipient undertaking receives a sum of money. Article 3 of the Investment Premium Law 1993 (InvZulG) was amended by Article 18(1) of the Finance Law 1996 (2) to the effect that the 8 % premium is now granted to investments which were begun after 31 December 1992 but before 1 July 1994 and which will be concluded before 1 January 1999. This extended the time-limit for the implementation of assisted investment projects by two years  but did not change the provisions governing the start of the investment. The Finance Law 1996 came into force on 1 January 1996. By letter dated 17 November 1995  the Federal Ministry of Finance informed the Länder tax authorities that the said provision must not be applied before the Commission has approved the aid pursuant to Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty. The letter was published in the Federal Tax Gazette (Bundessteuerblatt) 1996  Series I  No 1. II The Commission was informed of the amendment to the Investment Premium Law in a communication dated 19 December 1995  i.e. six working days before the entry into force of the Finance Law 1996; the amendment was therefore registered as a non-notified aid (NN 6/96). On 3 July 1996 the Commission decided  because the period in which the 8 % investment premium may be claimed was being extended  to initiate the procedure under Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty. Its reason for so doing was that the extension constituted additional State aid for investment projects which were begun before 1 July 1994 and which will be completed in 1997 and 1998  since no extra investment compared with the original situation was being promoted. The measure would therefore not assist any new investment projects which could contribute to the regional economic development of the former GDR. Consequently  the aid would only boost the equity of the undertakings which before July 1994 had begun to invest in the new Länder; it would accordingly have to be regarded as operating aid  which  as the Commission has consistently held  is compatible with the common market only if certain conditions are met and the aid serves exclusively to assist the economic development of areas in accordance with Article 92(3)(a) of the EC Treaty. The Commission took the view  however  that the aid could also stimulate economic development outside these assisted areas  with the result that the question was whether the aid could exceptionally be declared compatible with the common market. Germany was informed by letter dated 31 July 1996 (3) of the initiation of the procedure and  like the other Member States and interested parties  was invited by publication of that letter in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4) to submit its comments. Germany submitted its comments by letter dated 9 September 1996  and the French undertaking Elf Aquitaine SA (Elf) by letter dated 29 October 1996. On 30 October 1996  the French Government gave its views making reference to Elf's submission. It is clear from Elf's comments that the measure in question relates to investment by the Elf subsidiary Mitteldeutsche Erdöl-Raffinerie (MIDER)  which is building a new refinery at Leuna in Saxony-Anhalt. As a result of unforeseen technical difficulties  which the undertaking says it is not responsible for  the investment has been delayed. Without the proposed extension of the time-limit  the investment premium for the entire project could not be claimed  which would put MIDER at a considerable economic disadvantage. The letters from Elf and the French Government were forwarded for comment to the Federal Republic of Germany by letter dated 26 November 1996. Between December 1996 and July 1997 the matter was discussed at several meetings between the German authorities and the Commission's departments. III In Germany's view  the extension of the time-limit for investment projects for which the 8 % investment premium can be claimed is compatible with the common market. The extension will avert a reduction of investment aid for large projects where delays have occurred on account of the particular circumstances in eastern Germany. In this way  the equity of undertakings investing in the new Länder will be increased  thus contributing to their economic stability. According to Germany  it is not known how many cases are affected by the general extension of the time-limit for claiming the investment premium. Basically  the extension applies to all investment projects which were begun after 31 December 1992 and before 1 July 1994 and which had not been completed by the end of 1996. In the MIDER/Leuna 2000 case  which the competent authorities had in mind when they proposed the said provision  the undertaking could not conclude the investment project in time by the end of 1996 on account of unforeseeable technical and administrative problems for which the undertaking could not be held responsible. The total aid package for the Leuna 2000 refinery would have been some DEM 360 million lower than had been accepted when the privatisation agreement was concluded. For legal reasons  it was not possible to pass a Federal law just for the MIDER case. The Federal Government  however  declared its readiness to apply the Investment Premium Law as amended by the Finance Law 1996 to MIDER only and to notify individually any further cases to which the amendment would apply. IV The investment premium is State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 61(1) of the EEA Agreement. The extension of the time-limit for investment projects in respect of which an 8 % premium can be requested from 2 >NUM>1/ >DEN>2 to 4 years to 4 >NUM>1/ >DEN>2 to 6 years constitutes additional State aid. How many investment projects might be covered by the general extension of the time-limit is not known. Basically  the new time-limits apply to all investment projects which were begun after 31 December 1992 and before 1 July 1994 and which had not been concluded by the end of 1996. Undertakings which began investment projects between January 1993 and June 1994 took their decision in the full knowledge that projects which were not completed by the end of 1996 either would not qualify at all for the investment premium  since the finished part would not be regarded as a complete but smaller than planned investment  or  if the part completed in time is treated as a full investment  albeit smaller than planned  would qualify only to a certain extent. The particular problems which prevent the swift implementation of complex investment projects on the territory of the former GDR  such as organisational difficulties of regional and local authorities  possible environmental burdens and problems arising from the rules on the restitution of immovable property in the new Länder  were known and were the subject of comprehensive discussions before July 1994. Investment projects which were begun in the full knowledge that they could not be concluded in time and in respect of which the investment premium cannot therefore be claimed would nevertheless now be eligible for assistance  thus generating a windfall profit for undertakings which had originally calculated their investment in such a way that it would have been profitable even without such aid. Undertakings which have taken investment decisions regarding the 8 % investment premium without allowing time for investment-related risks have accepted investment aid which turns out to be potentially lower than if they had met the requirements laid down in the Investment Premium Law 1993  and despite those risks have regarded their investment as profitable. The extension of the time-limit does not generate any extra investment and will probably have no effect on the termination of investment projects already begun. Aid which does not stimulate any additional investment cannot be regarded as investment aid. State aid which  accordingly  constitutes only an additional payment that should not have been taken into account or which  according to the rules on regional investment aid applying at the time of the investment decision  was uncertain is to be regarded as operating aid for increasing the equity of the undertaking concerned  as was already explained by Germany before the initiation of the procedure in its communication of 19 December 1995. In its Communication on the method for the application of Article 92(3)(a) and (c) of the EC Treaty to regional aid (5)  the Commission explained that operating aid  despite the fact that it is such as seriously to distort competition  may exceptionally be regarded in assisted areas as compatible with the common market in accordance with Article 92(3)(a)  if it is necessary for the maintenance of the operation of existing plant. These considerations  however  do not apply to those undertakings which would benefit from the measure in question. Such undertakings decided before July 1994  with regard to the regional investment aid available under the law applicable at the time  to invest in the new Länder. Their investments were calculated in such a way that they would be achievable and show a steady profit without operating aid. There are therefore no extraordinary circumstances which would justify de facto operating aid in the form of an extension of the time-limit for claiming the 8 % investment premium as a contribution to the regional development of the disadvantaged regions. This de facto operating aid would  moreover  not only stimulate the economy in eastern Germany. Undertakings which meet the conditions may also maintain plant elsewhere and could thus use the aid to finance activities outside eastern Germany. The aid in question does not contribute  therefore  to the achievement of one of the objectives referred to in Article 92(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty  which the recipient undertakings under normal market conditions could not achieve either by their own efforts or with the help of existing approved State aid. The investment decisions were taken in the knowledge that the aid in question cannot be claimed if the time-limits are not observed. Aid which does not contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives recognised as justification for the exceptional approval of measures which distort competition cannot be regarded as compatible with the proper functioning of the common market (6). The Federal Government's proposal to apply the amendment of the Investment Premium Law 1993 made by the Finance Law 1996 only to MIDER/Elf Aquitaine and to notify further cases individually in advance does not alter the assessment. The Finance Law is a law passed by the Bundestag which may be relied on directly by any undertaking which meets the general assistance conditions. The number of potential recipients cannot be determined with certainty. The scope of the relevant provision of the Finance Law 1996 is not limited to the case of MIDER/Elf Aquitaine. There is no provision stating that it is up to the authorities to decide whether the premium will be granted. The commitment offered by Germany cannot effectively be made  since the Federal Government cannot declare a law passed by the Bundestag to be inapplicable or applicable on certain conditions. The authorities do not have the power to apply the relevant provision only in individual cases where it seems reasonable to them to do so. The relevant provision is therefore to be assessed with regard to all potential cases of application and not just to the MIDER case. The above comments  however  are without prejudice to a possible individual notification by Germany of particular measures modifying the aid package for MIDER's investment in eastern Germany. Such an amendment would be examined by the Commission with regard to the special circumstances of this particular investment and the positive decision of the Commission on this project (7). V In conclusion  therefore  the Commission finds that the aid in question does not contribute to the promotion of additional investment in the new Länder and is not necessary for the maintenance of existing economic activities in them. As a result  the aid does not contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives referred to in Article 92(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty and is not compatible therefore with the proper functioning of the common market. The aid scheme was wrongly brought into force on 1 January 1996 without prior approval by the Commission. The Commission has noted that Germany has instructed the authorities in the new Länder to apply the Law only after it has been approved by the Commission. This communication  however  cannot be opposed to the direct application of a Federal law which gives all potential recipients who meet the conditions a legal claim  without a discretionary decision by the authorities being necessary ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

No residual anti-dumping duties were imposed at that time since  in particular  the USSR and Chinese exporters  which actually gave the undertakings  held a monopoly on exports  of the product concerned from their countries. (2) Subsequently  the USSR exporter  V/O Stankoimport  lost its monopoly on exports. Exports are now carried out by a number of new exporters  located in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. As far as China is concerned  undertakings were accepted from  six trade organizations authorized by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to export this product from China. The Commission has now found that exports are being made from China by other exporters and trade organizations previously unknown to the Commission.  It has also been established that exports of artificial corundum from China  the Russian Federation and Ukraine have taken place in substantial quantities and at prices well below the undertaking prices. (3) The effect of this development is that the existing measures for China  the Russian Federation and Ukraine have become ineffective. Furthermore  the current situation discriminates against the exporters which undertook not to sell artificial  corundum below certain price levels and thus to eliminate the injurious effect of dumping. (4) The Council  therefore  considers that the facts as outlined above now require the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty  on the basis of the findings set out in Decision 91/512/EEC which the Council still considers valid  on imports of  artificial corundum originating in the People's Republic of China  the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The Council further considers that the findings of the investigation carried out prior to its adoption remain reliable and that duties may therefore  still be based on them. The exporters which had undertakings accepted and respected their provisions should continue to be exempt from the anti-dumping duty. (5) Consequently  a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the rates corresponding to those established in the above investigation  i.e. 30 8 % in respect of the People's Republic of China and 9 8 % in respect of the Russian Federation and  Ukraine. (6) Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 provides for measures to lapse after five years from the date on which they entered into force or were last modified or confirmed. Although the measures provided for by this Regulation imposing  definitive anti-dumping duties are linked to the undertakings accepted by Decision 91/512/EEC  this Regulation does not amend or confirm the latter within the meaning of Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 and consequently the date on which  the undertakings were due to expire pursuant to Article 15 (1) remains unchanged ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Canada  Croatia  Morocco  New Zealand  Tunisia  Turkey and the United States of America have been included in that temporary list  based on current trade with Member States  while awaiting Community assessment of the guarantees these third countries can provide with respect to mollusc diseases. (3) The animal health guarantees provided by Morocco  New Zealand  Tunisia and Turkey have been assessed by the Commission  and found not to meet all the requirements laid down in Directive 91/67/EEC and Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs (3). (4) Canada and New Zealand have notified the Commission that they have no current interest in exporting live molluscs for further growth  fattening or relaying to the Community. (5) The United States of America has submitted its programme for export certification of mollusc farming areas. That programme has been assessed by the Commission  and found to provide the necessary guarantees for export of live molluscs for further growth  fattening or relaying into the Community. (6) Croatia is not authorised for export of live molluscs for human consumption  pursuant to Commission Decision 97/20/EC of 17 December 1996 establishing the list of third countries fulfilling the equivalence conditions for the production and placing on the market of bivalve molluscs  echinoderms  tunicates and marine gastropods (4). Accordingly  imports of such mollusc from that country should not be authorised under Decision 2003/804/EC. (7) It is also appropriate to simplify the table in Annex I to Decision 2003/804/EC.

1000,23.12.2005 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 340/31 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2125/2005 of 22 December 2005 laying down transitory measures arising from the adoption of improved trade arrangements concerning the export of certain processed agricultural products to Romania THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products (1)  and in particular Article 8(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) The Community has recently concluded a trade agreement for processed agricultural products with Romania in preparation for its accession to the Community. This agreement provides for concessions involving on the Community side the abolition of export refunds on certain processed agricultural products. (2) EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005 of 5 July 2005 concerning the improvement of the trade arrangements for processed agricultural products provided in Protocol 3 of the Europe Agreement (2) provides for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Romania  from 1 December 2005. (3) In return for the abolition of export refunds as set out in EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005  the Romanian authorities have undertaken to grant reciprocal preferential import arrangements to goods imported into their territory if the goods concerned are accompanied by a copy of the export declaration containing a special mention indicating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds. The full rate of duty applies in the absence of such documentation. (4) With the entry into force of EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005  goods for which operators have applied for refund certificates in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3) will no longer be eligible for refund when they are exported to Romania. (5) Reduction of refund certificates and pro rata release of the corresponding security should be allowed where operators can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the national competent authority that their claims for refunds have been affected by the entry into force of EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005. When assessing requests for reduction of the amount of the refund certificate and proportional release of the relevant security  the national competent authority should  in cases of doubt  have regard in particular to the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 of 21 December 1989 on scrutiny by Member States of transactions forming part of the system of financing by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and repealing Directive 77/435/EEC (4) without prejudice to the application of the other provisions of that Regulation. For administrative reasons it is appropriate to provide that requests for reduction of the amount of the refund certificate and release of the security are to be made within a short period and that the amounts for which reductions have been accepted are to be notified to the Commission in time for their inclusion in the determination of the amount for which refund certificates for use from 1 February 2006 shall be issued  pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005.

(2) Imports have been suspended from Argentina by Decision 2001/276/EC until 15 April 2001 as a precautionary measure until more detailed information can be obtained following changes in the health situation in Argentina and the suspension by Argentina of their exports of fresh meat to Canada  Chile and the USA. (3) Following this decision the competent authority of Argentina itself suspended exports to the Community of fresh meat from species susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease  introduced a reorganisation of the veterinary services and a completely new strategic plan including regionalisation to control foot-and-mouth is being developed. At least until these changes can be properly evaluated it is necessary to prolong this suspension. (4) The suspension of imports from Argentina was implemented through the replacement by Decision 2001/276/EC of the Annexes to Decision 93/402/EEC; for the sake of legal certainty it shall be necessary to adopt a new measure updating fully these Annexes and therefore it is not appropriate to limit in the meantime the validity of the current Annexes excluding Argentina. However the decision to suspend imports of meat from Argentina will be reviewed within 2 months of its notification. (5) Argentina stopped certifying consignments from 13 March 2001 and for the sake of legal certainty consignments produced and certified on or prior to this date should be accepted.

The three complainants allegedly represented 100 % of total PET video film output in the Community. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and material injury resulting therefrom  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced  by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4)  the initiation of an antidumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of PET video film originating in the Republic of Korea. (2) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned; the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. II. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (3) The complaining Community producers formally withdrew their complaint concerning imports of PET video film originating in the Republic of Korea. The Commission considered that a termination of the proceeding would not be against the interest of the Community.

PROCEDURE 1. Measures in force (1) In March 1998  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 495/98(2)  imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in the People's Republic of China (the PRC) and amended the measures in force against Ukraine pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2413/95(3). The duties took the form of a specific duty. 2. Initiation (2) On 13 June 2002  the Commission announced by a notice (Notice of Initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(4) the initiation of a partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports into the Community of ferro-silico-manganese originating in the PRC and Ukraine. (3) The review was initiated on an initiative of the Commission in order to examine the appropriateness of the measures in force. The current measure  namely a duty in the form of a specific duty  does not cater for situations in which imported goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation. 3. Investigation (4) The Commission officially advised exporting producers  the importers and the users known to be concerned and their associations  the representatives of the exporting countries concerned and the Community producers of the initiation of the proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the Notice of Initiation. (5) A number of exporting producers in the countries concerned  as well as Community producers and Community importers/traders made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested within the abovementioned time limit and who demonstrated that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted the opportunity to be heard. (6) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of the appropriateness of the measures in force. B. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (7) Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(5) envisages  for the determination of the customs value  an apportioning of the price actually paid or payable in situations where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation. (8) In order to avoid an excessive amount of anti-dumping duty being levied  the specific duty should  in case of damaged goods  be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable. According to the well-established rules set out by the Community Customs Code  the customs value is reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable. (9) No interested party submitted any comments or arguments against this proposal. (10) It is therefore concluded that in the absence of any substantiated argument from interested parties  in cases where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation and  therefore  the price actually paid or payable is apportioned for the determination of the customs value  the specific duty shall be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1019,COMMISSION DECISION of 11 March 1999 concerning an application submitted by Ecumet (UK) Ltd for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of silicon metal originating in Brazil (notified under document number C(1999) 559) (Only the English and Dutch texts are authentic) (1999/219/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (hereafter referred to as 'the basic Regulation`)  as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2)  and in particular Article 11(8) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Considering the following: A. ORIGINAL MEASURES (1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2305/92 (3) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of silicon metal originating in Brazil. The specific rate of duty applied to importations of the product when produced by Companhia Brasileira Carboreto de Calcio (hereafter 'CBCC`) was set at 18 3 %. (2) On 14 August 1996 CBCC submitted a request for an interim review (hereafter referred to as 'the review`) which was initiated on 7 January 1997 by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4). (3) Following the publication in February 1997 of a notice of impending expiry of the measures in force (5) and the receipt in May 1997 of a complaint lodged by the Liaison Committee of the ferro-alloy industry (hereafter referred to as 'EuroAlliages`)  the Commission announced the initiation of an expiry review by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (6). (4) Following the withdrawal by EuroAlliages of their request for an expiry review  both reviews were concluded by Commission Decision 98/164/EC (7) which terminated the proceeding and hence repealed the duty for CBCC. The above Decision concluded that there had been no dumping of the product by CBCC during the investigation period of the interim review  that is from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996. B. APPLICATION FOR REFUND (5) On 18 September 1996  1 October 1996  13 February 1997  22 May 1997  3 June 1997  20 August 1997  3 September 1997  18 November 1997  4  15 and 22 December 1997  20 January 1998  9 February 1998 and 24 March 1998 Ecumet (UK) Ltd. (hereafter referred to as 'the applicant`)  an independent customer of CBCC  submitted applications for the refund of NLG [. . .] (8) and GBP [. . .] (289 transactions in total) on imports of silicon metal originating in Brazil and released for free circulation in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The goods were sold for export to the Community by CBCC between 30 July 1995 and 23 January 1998. (6) On 21 November 1997  the applicant partially withdrew one application in respect of 8 transactions totalling GBP [. . .]. Following this withdrawal  the total amounts for which refunds are claimed are NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .]  (281 transactions in total). C. ARGUMENTS OF THE APPLICANT (7) The applicant claims that the dumping margin in respect of the silicon metal exported by CBCC and released into free circulation in the Community in the period January 1996 to February 1998 was significantly lower than the applicable duty rate of 18 3 %  which he paid for his imports. D. ADMISSIBILITY (8) The applications are inadmissible in respect of Five transactions for an amount of NLG [. . .] and 11 transactions for GBP [. . .] of anti-dumping duties because the time-limit of six months prescribed by the basic Regulation between the determination of duties to be levied and the submission of the applications for refund was not respected with regard to those transactions. (9) All of the applications submitted for the remaining claims of NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .] (265 transactions in total) correspond to definitive anti-dumping duties paid and were introduced within the time limits established in Article 11(8) of the basic Regulation. E. MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS 1. Evidence (10) In accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 11(8) of the basic Regulation  the applicant submitted in respect of the applications referred to in recital (9) of this Decision the necessary prima facie evidence relating to normal value and export prices showing that the duty collected exceeds the dumping margin calculated for the appropriate reference periods. (11) In particular  the Commission sought and verified all the information it considered necessary within the framework of this investigation and of the review investigation (see below). Verification visits were also made to the premises of CBCC within the framework of the review investigation. (12) The applications dependent on the findings of the review should be considered to be duly substantiated by evidence within the meaning of the Fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of the basic Regulation  which sets the time-limits for completing refund investigations  from the date on which the findings of the review were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities  that is 27 February 1998. (13) The remaining applications which were dealt with in the framework of the refund investigation should be considered to have been duly supported by evidence from the date on which the Commission's services were in receipt of all data necessary for the investigation  that is 6 August 1998. (14) The Commission  in pursuing this investigation  applied the same methodology as that used in the original investigation as required by Article 11(9) of the basic Regulation. 2. Reference periods (15) The dumping margin of the exporter CBCC was calculated for the following three reference periods: from 1 July 1995 to 31 December 1995  from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996 and from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997. 3. Merits of the transactions sold for export between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1996 The applications in respect of 105 transactions on which anti-dumping duties of NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .] were paid relate to invoices issued within the investigation period select for the review  that is from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996. The Commission considers that the information and findings of the review  which determined that there was no dumping of the product concerned by CBCC for the period 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996  should be used to determine whether and to what extent a refund is justified for the import transactions which were invoiced by CBCC between those dates. 4. Merits of the transactions sold for export between 1 July 1995 and 31 December 1995 and between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 1997 156 transactions relate to invoices issued by CBCC between 30 July 1995 and 31 December 1995 and between 17 January 1997 and 27 December 1997 for total amounts of NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .] of anti-dumping duties. As the transactions in question clearly fall outside the period of investigation used for the review of the measures and thus the conclusions of the review could not be applied to those transactions  the Commission services carried out an investigation to determine whether and to what extent a refund was justified. To that end  the dumping margin of CBCC was calculated for the periods of 1 July 1995 to 31 December 1995 and 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997. (a) Normal value It was found that CBCC's domestic sales volume exceeded 5 % of its export sales to the Community  in accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. It was also established that the silicon metal sold on the Brazilian market was comparable to the silicon metal exported from Brazil to the Community. In order to assess if and to what extent domestic sales were made in the ordinary course of trade  the unit value of each domestic transaction was compared with the cost of production per tonne reported by the company during the reference periods. It was found that the volume of sales made at prices equal to or above the cost of production were between 10 % and 80 % of the total domestic sales volume. Normal value was  therefore  established on the basis of the average domestic sales price of these sales only. (b) Export prices Export price was established by reference to the price actually paid for the silicon metal sold for export to independent buyers in the Community  in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. (c) Comparison Normal value was compared at an ex-factory level with the export price on a weighted average basis and at the same level of trade. For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability  in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. (d) Establishment of the dumping margin The refund investigation was concluded with a finding of no dumping by CBCC of the product concerned during the relevant periods of 1 July 1995 to 31 December 1995 and 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997. 5. Merits of the transactions sold for export in January 1998 Following the selection of the reference period of 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997  two applications related to invoices issued by CBCC on 23 January 1998 for an amount of NLG [. . .] and one of GBP [. . .] were lodged. The Commission considers that the finding of no dumping for the reference period of 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997 can be reasonably applied to these transactions. In particular  the Commission considers that these transactions took place immediately after the period examined  that the amount concerned is very small in proportion to the total volume of exports to the Community by CBCC during the reference periods and to the total amount claimed by the applicant and that a stable pattern of no dumping was consistently found for the transactions made for the two and half years preceding these transactions. Furthermore it was established that the average FOB export price decreased by less than 0 25 % and the domestic transactions were found  on average  to be both profitable and at prices consistently lower than the export prices. F. DISCLOSURE (16) The applicant received disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to adopt a Commission Decision concerning the refund application in question. The applicant made no comments. G. AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED (17) As the review and refund investigations established that there was no dumping for the product concerned when exported by CBCC in the three reference periods  and the Commission also considers that the finding of no dumping can be applied to the transactions invoiced in January 1998 as a result of the comparison with the rate of duty applied the applicant should be refunded NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .] ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1023,17.7.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 185/16 COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 626/2009 of 13 July 2009 concluding the partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of the anti-dumping duty on imports of certain graphite electrode systems originating in India THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’)  and in particular Articles 9 and 11(3) thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: 1.   EXISTING MEASURES (1) Following an investigation (‘the original investigation’)  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1629/2004 (2) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain graphite electrode systems originating in India. 1.1.   Initiation of an interim review (2) On the request of Hindustan Electro Graphite Limited (‘HEG’ or ‘the company’)  an Indian exporting producer subject to the anti-dumping measures in force  a partial interim review of the above-mentioned Regulation was initiated pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation. (3) This partial interim review was initiated based on prima facie evidence provided by the company that  as far as they were concerned  the circumstances on the basis of which measures were established had changed and that these changes were of a lasting nature. (4) The request alleged that the cost of production of the product concerned had reduced due to production efficiencies since the original investigation  and that the company had been able to significantly increase their export prices. They claimed therefore that the continued imposition of measures at the existing level  which were based on the level of dumping previously established  was no longer necessary to offset dumping. (5) Having determined  after consulting the Advisory Committee  that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of a partial interim review  the Commission published a notice (‘Notice of Initiation’) (3) and commenced an investigation  limited in scope to the examination of dumping. 1.2.   Parties concerned by the investigation (6) The Commission officially advised HEG  as well as the representatives of the exporting country and the Community industry  of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. (7) The Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant and received a reply within the deadlines set for that purpose. The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of dumping and carried out a verification visit at the premises of HEG in Bhopal  India. 1.3.   Review investigation period (8) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 (‘the review investigation period’ or ‘RIP’). 2.   PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT 2.1.   Product concerned (9) The product concerned by the current review is the same as that in the original investigation  i.e. graphite electrodes of a kind used for electric furnaces  with an apparent density of 1.65 g/cm3 or more and an electrical resistance of 6.0 μΩ.m or less  falling within CN code ex 8545 11 00 and nipples used for such electrodes  falling within CN code ex 8545 90 90 whether imported together or separately  originating in India. 2.2.   Like product (10) The current review has shown that the graphite electrode systems produced by HEG and sold on the Indian domestic market are similar to those exported to the Community and therefore could be considered to be like product to the product concerned. 3.   DUMPING 3.1.   Normal value (11) In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation  the Commission first examined whether the domestic sales of the product concerned to independent customers were representative  i.e. whether the total volume of such sales was equal to or greater than 5 % of the total volume of the corresponding export sales to the Community. The domestic sales of HEG were found to be representative during the investigation period. (12) The Commission then identified those product types sold domestically by that company which were identical or directly comparable with the types sold for export to the Community. (13) Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the volume of that product type sold on the domestic market to independent customers during the investigation period represented 5 % or more of the total volume of the comparable product type sold for export to the Community. (14) The Commission then examined whether the domestic sales of each type of graphite electrode system sold domestically in representative quantities could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. This was done by establishing the proportion of profitable domestic sales to independent customers  of each exported product type  on the domestic market during the investigation period. (15) For those domestic sales of each type of graphite electrode system sold domestically in representative quantities where the sales were over 80 % profitable by volume  normal value was therefore based on the actual domestic price of all transactions during the investigation period. (16) For all other exported types also sold on the domestic market  where the sales were less than 80 % profitable by volume  normal value was based on the domestic sales price of the profitable transactions during the investigation period. (17) Wherever domestic prices of a particular product type could not be used in order to establish normal value  another method had to be applied. In accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation the Commission instead calculated a constructed normal value  as follows. (18) Normal value was constructed by adding to the exporter’s manufacturing costs of the exported types  a reasonable amount for selling  general and administrative expenses (‘SG&A expenses’) and a reasonable margin of profit. (19) In all cases SG&A expenses and profit were established pursuant to the methods set out in Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. To this end  the Commission examined whether the SG&A expenses incurred and the profit realised by the exporting producer on sales on the domestic market of the like product constituted reliable data and in this case determined that it was suitable to be used to construct normal value. 3.2.   Export price (20) All export sales of the product concerned by HEG were made directly to independent customers in the Community  and therefore the export price was established on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product concerned in the RIP in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. 3.3.   Comparison (21) The comparison between the normal value and the export price was made on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. In order to ensure a fair comparison  account was taken  in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation  of differences in factors which were demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability. On this basis  allowances  where applicable and justified  were made for differences in rebates  transport costs  insurance  handling charges  packaging  credit costs and import duties. 3.4.   Dumping margin (22) As provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation  the weighted average normal value by type was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned. (23) HEG’s dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the net  free-at-Community-frontier price  duty unpaid  was found to be de minimis in the sense of Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation. 4.   LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES (24) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation  it was also examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably be said to be of a lasting nature. (25) Whereas the cost of production of the company had not significantly decreased since the original investigation  the export price of the product concerned had increased substantially during the RIP  thereby removing the dumping findings of the original investigation. (26) Latest available data collected for the period after the RIP showed the import prices from HEG to have remained both high and stable  thereby confirming that the company continued with its non-dumping behaviour after the RIP. (27) It was also found that  during the RIP  exports by HEG to markets other than the EU were made at prices above prices on the Indian domestic market. (28) In these circumstances  the findings from the RIP can be considered to be lasting. 5.   ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES (29) As stated above  HEG was found to be dumping at a de minimis level during the RIP. It is however noted that  while the dumping margin established for the company concerned in the original investigation was 22 4 %  the anti-dumping duty presently in force against this company is 0 % (4).

(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted.

Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Tomatoes  oranges  lemons and apples of classes Extra  I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities. (8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community export  it is appropriate to proceed by an open invitation to tender and to fix the indicative refund amount and the scheduled quantities for the period concerned.

(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination  especially where the world market situation  the specific requirements of certain markets  or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.

whereas the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 are applicable to those quotas; Whereas the Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94 (5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 983/96 (6)  laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas these provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of this Regulation; Whereas certain characteristics of China's economy  the seasonal nature of some of the products and the time needed for transport mean that orders for products subject to quota are generally placed before the beginning of the quota year; whereas it is therefore important to ensure that administrative constraints do not impede the realization of the planned imports; whereas in order not to affect the continuity of trade flows  the arrangements for allocating and administering the 1999 quotas should accordingly be adopted before the start of the quota year; Whereas after examination of the different administrative methods provided for by Regulation (EC) No 520/94  the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted; whereas under this method the quotas are divided into two portions  one of which is reserved for traditional importers and the other for other applicants; Whereas this has proved to be the best way of ensuring the continuity of business for the Community importers concerned and avoiding any disturbance of trade flows; Whereas  however  the introduction of a Community system must ensure progressive access by non-traditional importers; whereas in the light of all these factors a balance must therefore be sought in determining the portions to be allocated to the two categories of importers; whereas  to this end  it is appropriate that the portion set aside for non-traditional importers should be increased as compared to 1998; Whereas the reference period used for allocating the portion of the quota set aside for traditional importers in earlier Regulations on the administration of these quotas should be updated to ensure open access to the quotas; whereas in order to allow a greater flexibility to the benefit of traditional importers it is considered appropriate to allow them to set their reference period as either 1996 or 1997  which are the most recent years representative of the normal trend of trade flows in the products in question; whereas traditional importers must therefore prove that they have imported products originating in China and covered by the quotas in question in the year 1996 or 1997; Whereas it has been found in the past that the method provided for in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94  which is based on the order in which applications are received  may not be an appropriate way of allocating that portion of the quota reserved for non-traditional importers; whereas  consequently  in accordance with Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 520/94  it is appropriate to provide for allocation in proportion to the quantities requested  on the basis of a simultaneous examination of import licence applications actually lodged  in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; Whereas in order to ensure that the quotas can be efficiently allocated and used  any speculative applications should be excluded  and it is furthermore necessary to allocate economically significant quantities; whereas to this end the amount that any non-traditional importer may request should be restricted to a set volume or value; Whereas for the purposes of quota allocation  a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers; Whereas the Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received  in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas the information about traditional importers' previous imports must be expressed in the same units as the quota in question; Whereas in view of the special nature of transactions concerning products subject to quota  and in particular the time needed for transport  the import licences should expire on 31 December 1999; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee for the administration of quotas set up pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

1068,COMMISSION DECISION  of 27 January 1992  terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of audio tapes on reels originating in Japan  the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong  (92/62/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries no members of the European Economic Community (1)  and in particular Article 9 thereof  After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) In November 1988 the Commission received a written complaint lodged by the European Council of Chemical Manufacturer's Federation (Cefic) on behalf of producers whose collective output of audio tapes on reels and in cassettes was stated to  constitute a major proportion of Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the product concerned originating in Japan  the Republic of Korea (Korea) and Hong Kong and of material injury resulting  therefrom  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced  by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of audio tapes on reels and in cassettes  falling within  CN codes 8523 11 00 and 8523 13 00 and originating in Japan  Korea and Hong Kong and commenced an investigation. (2) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be conerned  the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and  to request a hearing. (3) All of the known Korean exporters  most of the Japanese exporters  one Hong Kong expoerter and all complainant Community producers made their views known in writing. Submissions were also made by a number of importers. (4) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following: (a) Community producers AGFA Gevaert AG  Muenchen  Germany  BASF Aktiengesellschaft  Ludwigshafen  Germany  SUMA  Gien  France. These Community producers are all members of Cefic. (b) Japanese producers/exporters TDK  Tokyo  Denon Columbia  Tokyo. (c) Korean producers/exporters Saehan Media Co.

(e) Importers in the Community Sony  Bayonne  TDK Recording Media Europe GmbH  Rammelsbach  Denon Columbia GmbH  Ratingen  Sunkyong Europe Ltd  London. (5) The Commission requested and received detailed written and oral submissions from the Community producers represented by the complainant  from the exporters named and from a number of importers and verified the information provided to the extent  considered necessary. (6) For the reasons stated in recitals 9 to 12 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3262/90 (1)  confirmed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1251/91 (2)  it was considered necessary to treat audio tapes in cassettes and on reels as two different products.  Definitive anti-dumping duties have been imposed by the above Council Regulation on imports of audio tapes in cassettes from Japan and Korea. This Commission Decision is only concerned with audio tapes on reels. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (7) In July 1991 the Commission was informed by the complainant that it has decided to withdraw the complaint with regard to audio tapes on reels owing in particular to the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on audio tapes in cassettes (see  recital 6). The complainant stated  however  that it withdrew its petition without prejudice of a future action. (8) The Commission has no reason to believe that the termination of the proceeding would not be in the interest of the Community and considers that the anti-dumping proceeding should thus be terminated ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1069,Commission Regulation (EC) No 554/2004 of 25 March 2004 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1)  and in particular Article 31(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to that Regulation or to assimilated products. (5) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.

Whereas: A. EXISTING MEASURES (1) By Regulation (EC) No 393/98(2)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the People's Republic of China  India  the Republic of Korea  Malaysia  Taiwan and Thailand falling within CN codes 7318 12 10  7318 14 10  7318 15 30  7318 15 51  7318 15 61  7318 15 70 and 7318 16 30. B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE (2) Following the imposition of these definitive anti-dumping measures  the Indian companies Kundan Industries Limited and Tata International Limited  whose exports were subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 47 4 %  lodged an application for the annulment of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 393/98 before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. This application was entered in the Register of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities on 7 June 1998 as Case T-88/98. (3) By its Judgment of 21 November 2002(3)  the Court of First Instance of the European Communities annulled Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 393/98 insofar as it imposes a definitive anti-dumping duty on exports to the Community of stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof manufactured by Kundan Industries Limited and exported by Tata International Limited which exceeds that which would apply but for the adjustment to the export price made in respect of a commission. Since the original duty of 47 4 % was based on a dumping margin which included an adjustment of 2 % in respect of a commission  the anti-dumping duty is therefore annulled to the extent that it exceeds 45 4 %. (4) Consequently  in accordance with Article 233 of the Treaty  it is appropriate to amend the rate of duty established for Kundan Industries Limited and Tata International Limited in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 393/98 with retroactive effect. Amounts of anti-dumping duty paid in excess of a duty rate of 45 4 % on exports of stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof manufactured by Kundan Industries Limited and exported by Tata International to the European Community should be reimbursed ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1073,26.6.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 164/32 COMMISSION DECISION of 25 June 2007 repealing Decision 2005/704/EC accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People's Republic of China (2007/440/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation)  and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   EXISTING MEASURES (1) In October 2005  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 (2)  imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People's Republic of China (‘the product concerned’). (2) The Commission  by Decision 2005/704/EC (3)  accepted a price undertaking offered by Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co. Ltd  (‘the Company’). B.   BREACHES OF THE UNDERTAKING 1.   The undertaking (a)   Obligations of the company with regard to the undertaking (3) In the framework of the undertaking  the Company agreed  inter alia  not to sell the product concerned to the European Community below certain minimum prices (MIPs) laid down in the undertaking. (4) The terms of the undertaking also oblige the Company to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a quarterly report of its sales of the product concerned to the European Community. (5) For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the undertaking  the Company also undertook to allow on-the-spot verification visits at its premises in order to verify the accuracy and veracity of data submitted in the said quarterly reports and to provide all information considered necessary by the Commission. (b)   Other provisions of the undertaking (6) In addition  and as stipulated in the undertaking  the acceptance of the undertaking by the European Commission is based on trust and any action which would harm the relationship of trust established with the European Commission shall justify the immediate withdrawal of the undertaking. (7) Furthermore  and as stipulated in the undertaking  any changes in circumstances occurring during the period of implementation of the undertaking from those circumstances prevailing at the time of acceptance of the undertaking which were relevant to the decision to accept the undertaking may give rise to the withdrawal of the undertaking by the European Commission. 2.   Verification visit to the Company (8) In this regard  a verification visit was carried out at the premises of the Company in the People's Republic of China. (9) Two days before the verification visit  the Company submitted revised versions of the undertaking reports for the second and third quarter of 2006. The revisions submitted concerned — inter alia — a prolongation of the terms of payment for five transactions. These adjustments for the time allowed for payment have led to prices below the MIP. (10) Furthermore  the verification visit established a change in the pattern of trade to the European Community after imposition of anti-dumping measures. During the investigation period of the investigation that led to the imposition of the existing measures  the Company sold to the Community exclusively the product concerned. After imposition of measures the Company started to sell also other products to its clients in the Community. (11) Such a change in the pattern of trade affects the undertaking insofar as it constitutes a serious risk of cross-compensation  i.e. the product not covered by the undertaking may be sold at artificially low prices in order to compensate the MIP for the product covered by the undertaking. (12) In order to further assess whether such compensation actually took place  the Company was requested to provide copies of invoices of the product not covered by the undertaking  issued to other clients inside and outside the European Community. (13) The Company argued that an analysis of prices of other products is not meaningful to identify cross-compensation since the qualities and associated prices of these products may vary from client to client. In order to address those concerns  the Company was asked to provide a price list broken down by different qualities and clients but refused to do so and alleged that it concerned confidential information for products not covered by measures. (14) Finally  the Company provided copies of five invoices for products not covered by the undertaking  issued in 2005 and 2006. One invoice was issued to a customer buying at the same time the product covered by the undertaking  another invoice concerned a customer inside the Community that did not buy the product concerned from the Company. The remaining invoices were issued to customers outside the Community. (15) Taking into account the various qualities purchased by these five customers  it was found that the price charged to the customer in the Community  who bought also the product covered by the undertaking  was significantly lower than the price charged for similar qualities to the other client in the Community who did not buy the product covered by the undertaking. A similar price difference applied to the other clients outside the Community. This pricing policy is therefore considered as a clear indication that cross-compensation actually took place. 3.   Reasons to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking (16) The obligation of the Company to respect the MIP for all sales of the product covered by the undertaking was not met  as described in recital 9 above. (17) Furthermore  a change in the pattern of trade since the imposition of measures has led to a significant risk of cross-compensation which no longer allows the Commission to effectively monitor the undertaking and therefore renders the undertaking impractical. (18) It appears that this change in the pattern of trade allowed the Company to compensate customers in the Community for sales subject to the MIP by artificially low prices for the product not covered by the undertaking. (19) This change in the pattern of trade is considered as a relevant change in circumstances compared to those prevailing at the time of acceptance of the undertaking and should lead  taking into account the findings set out above in recitals 10 to 12  to the withdrawal of the undertaking. (20) In addition  by withholding the price lists for products not covered by the undertaking  the Company failed to comply with the obligation to provide relevant information in accordance with Article 8(7) of the basic Regulation and the provisions of the undertaking. (21) Furthermore  the unwillingness of the Company to provide these price lists harmed the relationship of trust which formed the basis for the acceptance of the undertaking. 4.   Written submissions (a)   Proportionality (22) With regard to the price violation  the Company admitted that a price violation occurred. The Company argued  however  that the sales prices of all other transactions were strictly in compliance with the MIP. Moreover  it was submitted that the final price was not significantly lower than the MIP. The Company claimed that  on this basis  the withdrawal of the undertaking would be disproportionate to the breaches that occurred. (23) In response to these arguments  regarding the issue of proportionality  it should be pointed out that in accordance with the undertaking  the Company undertook to ensure that the Net Sales Price of all sales covered by the undertaking shall be at or above the MIPs set out in the undertaking. (24) Moreover  the basic Regulation contains no direct or indirect requirement that a breach of an undertaking must relate to a minimum percentage of sales or must relate to a minimum percentage of the MIP. (25) This approach has also been confirmed by the jurisprudence of the Court of First Instance which has ruled that any breach of an undertaking is sufficient to justify the withdrawal of acceptance of an undertaking (4). (26) Accordingly  the arguments presented by the Company with regard to proportionality do not alter the Commission's view that a breach of the undertaking occurred and that the withdrawal of the undertaking would be proportionate to that breach. (b)   Change in the pattern of trade (27) With regard to the change in the pattern of trade  the Company submitted that it did not deliberately change its pattern of trade in order to compensate customers in the Community for sales subject to the MIP by artificially low prices for the product not covered by the undertaking. (28) It was argued that the price increase caused by the imposition of anti-dumping measures and the consequential decline in sales to the EU of the product concerned has led the Company to develop new products outside the scope of measures in order to maintain trade with the Community. (29) In response to these arguments  it should be underlined that the change in the pattern of trade as such constitutes a serious risk of cross-compensation  regardless for what reason it occurred. It is standing practice of the Commission not to accept price undertakings if the risk of cross-compensation is high. Consequently  if such a change in the pattern of trade occurs during the period of application of an undertaking  the change in itself is sufficient enough for the Commission to withdraw the undertaking  because it renders a proper monitoring of the undertaking impractical  regardless of whether or not a cross-compensation actually took place. (30) Accordingly  the arguments presented by the Company in this respect do not alter the Commission's view that the change in the pattern of trade had led to a significant risk of cross-compensation. (c)   Compensation scheme (31) The Company further submitted that it is a reasonable strategy and common business practice to offer favourable prices when trying to penetrate a market with a new product and that therefore it cannot be concluded that compensation actually took place  in particular since the volume of sales of the new product were nowhere near enough to fully compensate the loss in sales of the product covered by the undertaking. (32) In response to this submission  it has to be stressed that a favourable price was only offered to a client buying both the product covered by the undertaking and other products. It was not offered to another client in the EU which does not buy the product covered by the undertaking. Therefore  the very high price charged to the other client in the EU for a similar quality undermines this argumentation and strengthens the argument that cross-compensation actually took place. (33) Furthermore  as concerns the issue of materiality and proportionality  it should be stressed that there is no requirement on the Commission to demonstrate that a drop in sales of the product concerned has been offset by an equivalent rise in sales of new products when assessing whether cross-compensation has taken place. (d)   Information to be provided (34) Additionally  the Company contested having denied providing a price list for products not covered by the undertaking but argued that it does not have a universal price list since different prices apply to different customers in different regions. (35) In reply to this submission  it has to be recalled that the Company has been asked to provide those price lists that are available in order to overcome that problem  but was unwilling to do so since it was alleged that it concerned confidential information for products not covered by measures. (36) Accordingly  the arguments presented by the Company in this respect do not alter the Commission's view that the Company failed to comply with the obligation to permit verification of pertinent data in accordance with Article 8(7) of the basic Regulation. C.   REPEAL OF DECISION 2005/704/EC (37) In view of the above  the acceptance of the undertaking should be withdrawn and Decision 2005/704/EC should be repealed. Accordingly  the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 on imports of the product concerned from the Company should apply ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) Point 9 of that Annex enables the Commission to allocate an additional number of days at sea for which a vessel may be present within that area when carrying on board such beam trawls or static nets  on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place since 1 January 2004. (3) The United Kingdom has submitted data demonstrating that vessels which ceased activities since 1 January 2004  excluding those already taken into account in earlier years  deployed 3 36 % of the fishing effort expended during the year 2003  taken as reference period for vessels present in the area and carrying on board beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm. (4) In view of the data submitted and applying the calculation method foreseen under point 9.1  six additional days at sea should be allocated to the United Kingdom for the period between 1 February 2008 and 31 January 2009 for vessels carrying on board such beam trawls. (5) For reasons of clarity this Decision reflects the total amount of additional days allocated to the United Kingdom  and takes into account the 22 additional days at sea that have been previously allocated by Commission Decisions 2006/461/EC (2) and 2007/487/EC (3) on the allocation to the United Kingdom of additional fishing days within ICES division VIIe  as these additional days remain allocated in 2008.

1086,COMMISSION  DECISION of 30 October 1989 terminating the investigation concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Taiwan and accepting an undertaking offered in the context of the review concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan and terminating the proceeding (89/573/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  and in particular Articles 9 and 10 thereof  After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for in the above Regulation  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) In 1983 the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide in Japan (2)  and imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on this product (3). The Council later accepted the undertakings offered by the Japanese exporters of the product concerned (4). (2) In November 1988  pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  the Commission received requests from the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations (CEFIC) for a review of the measures taken against the Japanese exporter and for the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Taiwan. The requests contained what was judged to be sufficient evidence of dumping and of resulting material injury to warrant the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (3) Consequently  in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (5)  the Commission announced a review and the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan and Taiwan respectively. The Commission also pointed out that pursuant to Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 the undertakings given by the Japanese exporters covered by the review would remain in force pending the outcome of the review. (4) The Commission officially advised the exporters/producers and importers known to be concerned. Japan's representatives and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned an opportunity to make known their views in writing and request a hearing. (5) The Community  the exporters/producers and some importers made known their views in writing. One exporter requested and obtained a hearing. (6) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purposes of making a preliminary determination of dumping and carried out inspections at the premises of: (a) Community producers: - N.V. Hercules Europe SA  Brussels  Belgium  - Montefluos  Milan  Italy; (b) producers/exporters in non-member countries: - Concord Chemical industrial Co.  Taipei  Taiwan  - Nippon Oils and Fats Co. Ltd (NOF)  Tokyo  Japan. (7) The investigation covered the period from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1988. B. PRODUCT (8) This proceeding concerns imports of dicumyl peroxide falling within CN code 2909 60 10 (formerly Nimexe code 29 08 91). The product is used to vulcanize rubber and as an additive in fireproofed polystyrene. (9) In order to assess the effect on the Community industry of imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan or Taiwan  the Commission examined the degree to which the chemical and physical characteristics of the imported products and those from Community producers were comparable  and concluded that these characteristics and the use to which the product was put were identical. C. INITIATION OF ANTI-DUMPING PROCEEDING AND TERMINATION - TAIWAN 1. Dumping (a) Normal value (10) Normal value was calculated on the basis of the prices charged each month in transactions on the domestic market by the Concord Chemical Industrial Co.  which exported the product to the Community and provided satisfactory evidence. (b) Export price (11) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product sold for export to the Community. (c) Comparison (12) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission  in accordance with Article 2 (10) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  took account where appropriate of differences affecting price comparability  such as transport  commissions and credit terms. Monthly normal value figures were compared with export prices for the corresponding month on an ex works basis  transaction by transaction. (d) Dumping margins (13) The dumping margin was calculated as being the difference between the normal value established and the duly adjusted export price in the Community. On the basis of the free-at-Community-frontier price no dumping margin emerged. 2. Injury (14) In the light of this failure to find that dumping was taking place  the Commission considered that there were no grounds for determining whether or not injury had occurred as a result of the imports in question and thus whether or not there was a threat of injury. 3. Termination of the proceeding (15) In the light of the above  notably the absence of dumping  the Commission considers that no protective measures are needed and that the proceeding should be terminated. D. REVIEW (SUNSET) - JAPAN 1. Dumping (a) Normal value (16) Normal value was calculated on the basis of the prices charged each month in transactions on the domestic market by NOF  which exported the product to the Community and provided satisfactory evidence. (b) Export price (17) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product sold for export to the Community. (c) Comparison (18) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission  in accordance with Article 2 (10) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  took account where appropriate of differences affecting price comparability  such as transport  commissions and credit terms. Monthly normal value figures were compared with export prices for the corresponding month on an ex-works basis  transaction by transaction. (d) Dumping margins (19) The dumping margin was calculated as being the difference between the normal value established and the duly adjusted export price in the Community. On the basis of the free-at-Community-frontier price the weighted average margin was 52 % for NOF. 2. Injury over the period covered by the investigation (20) In order to determine whether the dumped imports had injured the Community industry  the Commission took account of the following factors. (a) Volume of dumped imports (21) The Commission observed that between 1985 and 1988 imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan remained stable at the level of the quantitative undertaking given by the Japanese producer. (22) Japan's market share has fallen from 14 % to 8 % as a result of the growth in the consumption of dicumyl peroxide in the Community  which has risen by 79 %  from 880 tonnes to 1 576 tonnes. (b) Difference in prices (23) As regards the import prices  the evidence in the Commission's possession reveals no undercutting of the Community industry's prices during the reference period. It should be noted that over 60 % of the Japanese exports go to Belgium  where their only buyer  for reasons of security of supply  purchases at the same price from all its suppliers  whether these be from within the Community or not. The price is quite substantially higher than that paid by other customers. (24) Given the specific nature of this situation  the Commission examined the impact of the price of Japanese imports in relation to production costs in the Community  with a profit level of 15 % added  this being considered reasonable and usual in the industry in order to ensure its development. The Commission established that the prices of the Japanese imports were 32 % lower on the German market  the only representative one in this case  since the Japanese exporter's sales on the Spanish market are low and the Belgian market is influenced by the dominant position of the user. (c) Impact on the Community industry (25) The Commission noted the following: - Community production Between 1985 and 1988 Community production of dicumyl peroxide rose from 590 tonnes to 1 403 tonnes  an increase of approximately 138 %. - Utilization of capacity Utilization of Community production capacity has risen from 39 % to 62 %. Though this is not an insignificant rise  utilization of production capacity remains far below what it should be  particularly in comparison with that of the producers in the non-member countries covered by the investigation. - Sales and market share Between 1985 and 1988 Community producers' sales of dicumyl peroxide rose both on the Community market (up 128 %) and on export markets (up 193 %). Their market share in the Community therefore rose from 52 % to 66 %. - Price reductions An examination of the information obtained showed an appreciable drop in prices on the Community market between 1985 and 1988. - Profitability The profitability of Community producers has deteriorated substantially in the last two years. Within the Community industry since 1987  one producer's losses have risen considerably  and the profits of another decreased drastically. (26) On the basis of the figures given above the Commission has come to the following conclusions: - a situation of contrast emerges; while some negative points  such as under-utilization of production capacity and particularly a deterioration of financial performance  are apparent  other aspects show a degree of buoyancy. Community production has risen considerably over the last four years  sales inside and outside the Community have increased sharply and the market share of Community producers has improved substantially. in addition to these factors  the following were considered: - imports from the Japanese exporter have remained stable in quantity terms. Its market share has decreased  as it has been unable to profit from the increase in Community consumption of dicumyl peroxide because of the quantity undertaking. Moreover  no price undercutting on its part could be found (see point 23)  although some instances of prices lower than those prevailing on the Community market were found (see point 24)  - in addition  it should be noted that the drop in prices which occurred on the Community market can be put down partly to competition from Taiwanese imports and partly to technical progress in production processes. (27) The considerations set out above led the Commission to conclude that even if the Community industry's situation is not flourishing the difficulties confronting it are not a result of the impact of dumped Japanese imports. 3. Threat of injury as a result of the expiry of the measures in force (28) It should none the less be determined whether the expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force is likely to cause or threaten to cause injury. In this connection the Commission has taken the following into account: - the Japanese producer  which already produces substantialy more than any of the Community producers  anticipates a rise in its dicumyl peroxide production of 16 % by 1990. Given the situation of the Community market this can be regarded as a significant increase  - considering that its exports to the Community in 1988 accounted for less than 7 % of its sales  there is a high probability that the exporter in question will be led to increase its share of the Community market in the near future  since its prospects on its domestic market and the markets of non-Community countries seem limited  - the Commission also took account of the fact that a dumping margin of 52 % had been calculated for 1988. Although the difficulties the Community industry is facing are largely attributable to other factors it is very likely that a serious distortion of the Community market would occur if the restrictions currently in force were lifted. The reason is that the exporter concerned would see an advantage in dumping products on the Community market: the exporter can rely on substantial profits from the domestic market  and would be able to align prices on those of other producers or even undercut them. This would expose the Community producers to unfair competition from the Japanese exporter  something which would be likely to increase their financial losses and thus cause considerable injury. E. COMMUNITY INTEREST (29) In the light of the observations set out above  and considering particularly the size of the dumping margin  the genuine threat of injury and the absence of representations from users and consumers  the Commission takes the view that a failure to institute measures would in time lead to the disappearance of the Community industry; this in turn would make the downstream industries  notably the cable industry  more vulnerable from the point of view of supply. In this connection  the Japanese exporter expressed the opinion that it would not be in the Community's interest to institute measures solely against Japan. According to the exporter  Japan itself would then not be in a position to compete against its competitors  particularly the Taiwanese  which charged very low prices; it would as a result be excluded from the Community market  to the profit of its competitor. (30) The Commission regards this argument as unfounded in so far as the retention of protective measures against Japan should not have any substantial effect on the present state of competition between the two countries  considering the destination of Japanese exports. Whatever the case  the Commission considers that the protective measure it intends to take will ensure fair competition on the Community market. (31) In the light of the above  the Commission confirms that it is in the interest of the Community to retain protective measures against the imports concerned. F. UNDERTATING AND TERMINATION OF THE REVIEW (32) Having been notified of the main conclusions  NOF  the Japanese exporter  offered an undertaking on the price of its exports of dicumyl peroxide to the Community. This undertaking will bring the price of exports to the Community to a level which the Commission considers sufficient to prevent the injury which the expiry of the anti-dumping measures currently in force would otherwise inevitably have brought about. (33) In these circumstances the undertaking should be considered acceptable  and since the Advisory Committee has expressed no objection to the proposals the investigation may therefore be terminated.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) In the framework of the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations initiated by two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (6)  the Commission had accepted  on 26 September 1997  by Decision 97/634/EC (7)  undertakings offered by the Kingdom of Norway and by 190 Norwegian exporters. These undertakings apply to all sales invoiced by these exporters since 1 July 1997. Subsequent to the acceptance of these undertakings  the Commission had reasons to believe that 29 exporters were failing to comply with the terms of these undertakings: - it appeared from their reports relating to the third quarter 1997 that six Norwegian exporters had made sales on the Community market below the minimum price stipulated in the undertaking for each presentation of the product concerned  - 23 Norwegian exporters failed to comply with their obligation to submit their report relating to the third quarter 1997 within the prescribed time limit  or did not submit such report at all. These exporters did not provide any evidence of force majeure to justify such late reporting. (2) Consequently  the Commission  by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2529/97 (8)  hereinafter referred to as the Provisional Duty Regulation  imposed provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon falling within CN codes ex 0302 12 00  ex 0304 10 13  ex 0303 22 00 and ex 0304 20 originating in Norway and exported by the companies listed in Annex I to that Regulation. B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE (3) All Norwegian companies concerned by the provisional duties received disclosure in writing concerning the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which these duties were imposed. (4) Within the time limit set in the Provisional Duty Regulation  most of the Norwegian companies concerned submitted comments in writing. (5) Subsequent to the written submissions received  the Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a definitive determination on the apparent violations  and carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies in Norway: - Fresh Marine Company AS (Taric additional code 8149)  and - Seanor AS (Taric additional code 8272). C. DEFINITIVE FINDINGS (6) During the subsequent procedure  four companies could provide satisfactory evidence demonstrating that the provisional findings resulted inter alia from erroneous or unclear reporting on the part of the companies concerned. In fact  the actual average sales prices of these companies for the respective presentations of the product concerned were such that they did not violate the minimum price as stipulated in the undertaking. (7) One of the companies which apparently had failed to send its undertaking report within the time limit set could finally provide evidence that despite the adverse prima facie evidence initially available  it had in fact delivered its report in time to the local post office. (8) For the aforementioned five exporters therefore  the breach of their undertakings provisionally established cannot be definitively confirmed. Consequently  following the exporters' confirmation that they intend to continue to adhere to their undertakings  the status quo ante should be re-established as regards these companies' undertakings. (9) Therefore  for the following five companies  the provisional measures are to be repealed  the amounts secured by way of provisional duty are to be released  and their undertakings reinstated. >TABLE> (10) Parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to repeal the provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties and reinstate their undertakings. No further comments were received. (11) None of the other companies which failed to respect their reporting obligations submitted any valid evidence of force majeure as allowed by the undertaking. In the absence of specific provisions in this regard in the basis anti-dumping and anti-subsidies regulations  and in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice  the justification invoked by each company as circumstances constituting force majeure can only be recognised as such where the failure was the inevitable result of an extraneous cause which could not reasonably have been foreseen or pre-empted and made it objectively impossible for the company concerned to comply with its obligations. In this regard  all circumstances invoked by the parties concerned  e.g. the holidays of a responsible person  misunderstanding about the scope of the undertakings  loss of time management software  erroneous filing of correspondence  cannot be considered as circumstances constituting force majeure. (12) On the basis of the foregoing it is concluded that two Norwegian exporters have breached their obligation to respect the minimum price. In addition  22 other Norwegian exporters have breached the reporting requirements of their undertakings. (13) Parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to confirm the withdrawal of the Commission's acceptance of their undertaking and to recommend the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties and the definitive collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duties. They were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to this disclosure. D. NEWCOMERS (14) Following the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties  several companies made themselves known to the Commission claiming to be new exporters  and offered undertakings. (15) In this regard  one such company  Nor-Fa Food AS could demonstrate that if had not exported to the Community during the investigation period relevant for the investigations which led to the current anti-dumping and countervailing measures. This company could show that it was not related to any of the exporters or producers in Norway which are subject to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures on farmed Atlantic salmon. Finally  it demonstrated that it had entered into irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity of farmed Atlantic salmon to the Community. The undertaking offered is identical in its terms to those previously accepted from other Norwegian exporters of farmed Atlantic salmon  and it is considered that the acceptance of an undertaking in these terms from this exporter will be sufficient to remove the injurious effects of dumping. Since the exporter has agreed to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information on its exports to the Community  it is concluded that the correct observance of the undertaking can be effectively monitored by the Commission. (16) The undertaking offered by this company is therefore considered acceptable. The company was informed of the essential facts and considerations on which the acceptance of the undertaking be based. The Advisory Committee was consulted and no objections were raised as to the acceptance of the undertaking offered. Therefore  pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1890/97 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1891/97  the Annexes to these two Regulations should be amended to extend the exemption from the payment of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties to this new exporter. E. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO DECISION 97/634/EC (17) The Commission is in parallel to this Regulation submitting a proposal for a Council regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and exported by the other 24 companies which are subject to the provisional duty imposed by the Provisional Duty Regulation and for which the breach of the undertaking has been confirmed by the definitive findings made. In addition  certain companies informed the Commission  that their name had been changed or that their name as shown in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC is not correct. Where a company has changed its name  the Commission verified that there was no change in the corporate structure which would call for a more detailed examination of the appropriateness of maintaining its undertaking. The Annex to Decision 97/634/EC accepting undertakings in the context of the present anti-dumping and anti-subsidies proceedings should be amended to take account of the acceptance of the undertaking by the newcomer Nor-Fa Food AS  the change of name of Skaarfish Group AS  the correction of the name indicated for West Fish Sales Ltd and the reinstatement of the undertakings given by the companies in respect of which the provisional duty is being repealed.

1110,Commission Regulation (EC) No 945/2003 of 28 May 2003 fixing the rates of refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1)  as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2)  and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15)  Whereas: (1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a)  (c)  (d)  (f)  (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in the Annex to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(4)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.

(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (6) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

Classification in CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06 requires compliance with a minimum free-at-frontier value if imports into the Community are to qualify for a preferential duty rate. Since from 1 June 2002  the date of entry into force of the bilateral agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning trade in agricultural products  signed in Luxembourg on 21 June 1999 and approved by Decision 2002/309/EC  Euratom of the Council and of the Commission(5)  eligibility for the preferential duty rate is no longer subject to compliance with a minimum free-at-frontier value  and since the cheeses covered by those codes are now imported under CN codes 0406 90 13 to 0406 90 17  as listed in Annex II(D) to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001  CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06 are no longer required. In order to avoid confusing importers and customs authorities  and pending the deletion of those codes from the Combined Nomenclature  the said Article should be adjusted and transitional rules adopted for licences issued before the date of entry into force of the agreement with Switzerland. (2) Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 stipulates that importers may lodge only one licence application each for the same quota in the integrated tariff of the European Communities (TARIC). The quota numbers listed in Annexes I(B)(2) and I(B)(3) to that Regulation for products originating in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are identical  since those two countries were previously one country. It should therefore be specified that the quotas concerned must be considered as separate quotas. (3) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended.

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76 (2) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) As the standing invitations to tender for the export refunds on rice have ended for this year  refunds in ordinary law for this product need no longer be fixed. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

(2) That procedure should be opened for exports during 2010 and the additional rules relating to it should be determined. (3) In administering imports the competent authorities in the USA make a distinction between the additional quota granted to the European Community under the Uruguay Round and the quotas resulting from the Tokyo Round. Export licences should be allocated taking into account the eligibility of those products for the USA quota in question as described in the Harmonised Tariff Schedule of the United States of America.

PROCEDURE (1) In June 2000  the Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping by imports of colour television receivers (CTVs) originating in or exported from Turkey. (2) The complaint was lodged by the Producers of European Televisions in Cooperation (Poetic) acting on behalf of Community producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of CTVs pursuant to Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation). (3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (4) The Commission  after consultation  by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3)  accordingly initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of CTVs  currently classifiable within CN codes ex 8528 12 52  8528 12 54  8528 12 56  8528 12 58  ex 8528 12 62 and 8528 12 66 and originating in or exported from Turkey. (5) It should be noted that in April 2000  two review investigations under Article 11(2) and (3) of the basic Regulation had been initiated regarding the anti- dumping measures applicable to imports of CTVs originating in the People's Republic of China  the Republic of Korea  Malaysia  Singapore and Thailand(4). (6) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers  importers and representative associations of importers or exporters known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country  the representative consumer organisations and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (7) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of its investigation. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: (a) Community producers Tecnimagen SA  Barcelona  Spain  Grundig AG  Nuremberg  Germany  Philips Consumer Electronics  Eindhoven  The Netherlands  Industrie Formenti Italia Spa  Lissone  Italy  Seleco Formenti Spa  Pordenone  Italy; (b) Exporters/producers and related sales companies in Turkey Profile Telra Elektronik Sanayi ve Ticaret AS  Istanbul (including the related sales companies PRO-EKS Dis Ticaret AS  Istanbul  Savunma Gerecleri AS  Istanbul  Elektrotem Elektronik Aletler Limited  Istanbul)  Beko Elektronik AS  Istanbul (including the related sales company Ram Dis Ticaret  Istanbul)  Vestel Elektronik Sanayi ve Ticaret AS  Manisa (including the related sales companies: Vestel Dis Ticaret AS  Istanbul  Vestel Dis Ticaret AS Ege Serbest Bolge SB  Izmir  Vestel Bilisim Teknolojileri Sanayi ve Ticaret AS  Istanbul  Vestel Komunikasyon Sanayi ve Ticaret AS  Izmir)  Izmir Elektronik Sanayi ve Ticaret AS  Izmir; (c) Related importers in the Community Beko (UK) Ltd  Watford  United Kingdom  Beko Electronics Espana SL  Barcelona  Spain  Vestel Holland BV  Rotterdam  Netherlands  Vestel Iberia  Madrid  Spain; (d) Unrelated importers in the Community Alba plc Barking  United Kingdom. B. FINDINGS ON ORIGIN (8) CTVs frequently incorporate components and parts originating in countries other than the country of manufacture or assembly of the finished product  with the result that CTVs may be considered as originating in a country other than the country of manufacture or assembly. Thus  in accordance with the Community's consistent practice and pursuant to Article 1(3) of the basic Regulation  the examination of the origin of the CTVs exported from Turkey formed part of the anti-dumping investigation. (9) Origin was examined in the light of Article 22 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(5) of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code  which establishes that the non-preferential rules of origin apply to all non-preferential commercial policy instruments  such as anti-dumping. (10) In accordance with Article 39 and Annex 11 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(6) laying down provisions for the implementation of the Community Customs code  specific non-preferential rules of origin apply for CTVs. According to these rules  a CTV is considered to originate in the country where the added value of the assembly operations  and  if applicable  the incorporation of parts originating in the country of assembly represents at least 45 % of the ex-works price of the CTV. When the 45 % rule is not met  the CTV originates in the country of origin of parts whose ex-works price represents more than 35 % of the ex-works price of the CTV. (11) When applying the specific non-preferential origin rules in the present investigation  it was established that the origin of all CTVs exported to the Community between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2000 (investigation period or IP) was other than Turkish. Exports to the Community were instead found to have their origin in the exporting countries subjected to the review investigations mentioned in recital 5  the Community or other third countries not subject to any investigation. In particular  it was found that for the exports of the investigated companies which correspond to all exports of CTVs from Turkey to the Community during the IP  the 45 % added value rule was not met. Thus  the origin had to be determined on the basis of the 35 % value rule of the non-originating parts/materials. (12) On the basis of the 35 % value rule of the non-originating parts/materials it was established that the origin of the cathode-ray colour television picture tube (CPT) virtually determined the origin of the CTVs  since the ex-works price of the CPT represented  in all cases  at least 35 % of the ex-works price of the CTV. It should be noted that there is no production of CPTs in Turkey and  therefore  all CPTs are imported. Accordingly  the origin examination concluded that the CTVs exported from Turkey during the IP were of the origins of the CPTs used in their assembly. C. TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (13) In view of the above findings on origin  the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of CTVs originating in Turkey should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures. (14) All interested parties received disclosure of the findings on origin and were given an opportunity to comment and to be heard. One interested party contested the applicability of the non-preferential rules of origin in the case of Turkey  given the EC-Turkey Customs Union. However  neither Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 on implementing the final phase of the Customs Union(7)  nor the Community Customs Code provides for a derogation from the applicability of the non-preferential rules of origin in the case of imports from countries which are in a customs union with the Community. (15) Finally  the Community industry argued that the origin criteria was irrelevant since the basic Regulation allowed the imposition of anti-dumping measures on the basis of the country of provenance. It should be noted that it is the consistent practice of the Community to impose anti-dumping measures solely on products originating in a third country. This was also the case in previous investigation on imports of the same product(8) ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Following a Community mission  it appears that the animal health situation in Latvia compares favourably with that in the Member States  particularly as regards disease transmission through meat  and that the operation of controls over the production of fresh meat is satisfactory. (3) For the purpose of Article 4(3) of Directive 72/462/EEC  Latvia has forwarded details of the establishments that should be authorised to export fresh meat to the Community. (4) The establishments put forward by Latvia meet all the requirements laid down in Directive 72/462/EC in order to be designated as slaughterhouses and approved cutting plants from which imports into the European Union may be permitted in accordance with Article 18 of the Directive. (5) A Community inspection has shown that the hygiene standards of those establishments are satisfactory and that they may therefore be included on the first list of establishments  to be drawn up in accordance with Directive 72/462/EEC  from which imports of fresh meat may be authorised.

(2) France has submitted a plan to the Commission for an authorised entry point located in the French overseas department of Mayotte. That plan details the facilities  the necessary equipment and the trained staff to carry out the veterinary checks to verify that Union public and animal health requirements for products of animal origin are met. (3) In addition  that plan demonstrates that all consignments of products of animal origin are required to be presented for import at the authorised entry point and that their dispatch into other parts of Union territory is effectively prevented. It also shows that the specific requirements laid down in Articles 3  4 and 5 of Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU are met. (4) The entry point of the French overseas department of Mayotte should therefore be added to the list of authorised entry points  as regards certain products of animal origin. (5) Article 1 and the Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds. (3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products""  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ""other cereals""  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) However  in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets  allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.

The amounts received by producer organisations should be used to finance measures adopted in order to achieve the aims referred to in Article 122(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (2) So as to ensure the orderly management of the payments  Germany should adopt rules on the submission of applications by producer organisations  including deadlines  and ensure that all applications contain the information that is needed in order to allow the German competent authority to verify whether producer organisations are entitled to payments. (3) In order to ensure that payments are made in a fair manner  the amounts to be paid to producer organisations should be calculated on a pro rata basis  linked to the eligible hops areas of their members. (4) In order to ensure the efficient use of financial resources  payments made by the competent German payment agency should be committed within a reasonable period of time. (5) In order to protect the financial interests of the European Union  no payments should be made before checks in respect of the eligibility criteria have been made. These control measures should involve administrative checking supplemented by on-the-spot controls. Amounts unduly paid should be recovered and sanctions should be determined in order to deter applicants from fraudulent behaviour and serious negligence. (6) Article 63(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (3) which has established common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy as well as certain support schemes for farmers has integrated the partially coupled payments in the hops sector into the single payments scheme from 1 January 2010.

(2) The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of 6 December 1951 concluded at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) specifies in its Annex models of certificates providing a standard wording and format that should be followed for the preparation and issue of certificates. (3) The IPPC was significantly amended in 1979 and 1997. As a consequence of those amendments different models of the certificates were approved to accompany plants  plant products and other objects when moving in international traffic. (4) Although the amendments of the IPPC in 1997 have not yet entered into force  Resolution 12/97 of the 29th session of the Conference of the FAO allowed the use of the amended certificates as an alternative and on voluntary basis among Contracting Parties to the IPPC that accept them. It appeared that many Contracting Parties to the IPPC already use the certificates based on the models specified in the Annex to the IPPC  as amended in 1997. (5) The models of certificates to accompany plants  plant products or other objects for entry into the Community should be determined. (6) National plant protection organisations usually stock up certificates in large quantities.

(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation. (6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter  taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g)  the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h)  the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.

(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 800 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 409/2001(5) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) An inspection carried out by the Commission in Botswana in May 2001 has shown that sufficiently well-structured and organised veterinary services are in place in Botswana regarding the animal health status for ratites. However  the legislation in Botswana did not fully include the requirement for official notification of avian influenza. (3) Botswana has now amended its legislation to ensure that avian influenza is to be notified to the competent authority. (4) It is therefore appropriate to permit importation of live ratites and hatching eggs from Botswana. (5) Decision 2001/751/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

(2) The European Union strategy for the beginning of the new millennium on the prevention and control of organised crime emphasises the need to develop a comprehensive EU policy against corruption. (3) In its Resolution of 14 April 2005 concerning a comprehensive EU policy against corruption  which refers to the communication from the Commission to the Council  the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee of 28 May 2003 on a Comprehensive EU Policy against Corruption  the Council reaffirms the importance of the role and work of the Member States in developing a comprehensive  multi-faceted policy against corruption in both the public and private sectors  in partnership with all relevant players from civil society and business alike. (4) The European Council welcomed the development in the Hague Programme (3) (point 2.7) of a strategic concept with regard to cross-border organised crime and corruption at EU level and asked the Council and the Commission to develop this concept further and make it operational. (5) The heads and key representatives of EU Member States' national police monitoring and inspection bodies and those of their anti-corruption agencies with a wider remit met in November 2004 in Vienna at the AGIS conference on the Enhancement of Operational Cooperation in Fighting Corruption in the European Union. They emphasised the importance of further enhancing their cooperation  inter alia  through annual meetings  and welcomed the idea of a European anti-corruption network based upon existing structures. In the wake of the Vienna conference these European Partners Against Corruption (EPAC) met in Budapest in November 2006 for their sixth annual meeting  where with an overwhelming majority  they confirmed their commitment to supporting the initiative on setting up a more formal anti-corruption network. (6) In order to build upon existing structures  the authorities and agencies to form part of the European anti-corruption network could include EPAC member organisations. (7) The enhancement of international cooperation is generally (4) recognised as a key issue in the fight against corruption. The fight against all forms of corruption should be improved by cooperating effectively  identifying opportunities  sharing good practices and developing high professional standards. The establishment of an anti-corruption network at EU level is an important contribution to the improvement of such cooperation ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

1228,22.12.2004 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 374/44 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2206/2004 of 21 December 2004 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (1)  and in particular Article 14(3) and 19 thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003  provides that when refunds are being fixed  account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availability of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76 (2) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) The maximum export refund for rend  medium and long A rice was fixed at a relatively low level. Consequently  it is not justified for the moment to fix a common right to refund for rice. (5) Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

By Regulation (EC) No 658/2002 (3)  following an expiry and interim review  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of the product concerned originating in the Russian Federation (Russia). (2) In March 2004  the Commission announced  through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union  (4)  the initiation of a partial interim review of the existing measures on imports of the product concerned originating in Russia and Ukraine (the measures) to examine whether they should be adapted to take account of certain consequences of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States (enlargement). (3) The Council concluded that it was in the interest of the Community to provide for the temporary adaptation of the existing measures so as to avoid a sudden and excessively negative impact on importers and users in the 10 new Member States acceding to the European Union (the EU-10) immediately following enlargement. It was considered that the best means of achieving this was through the acceptance of undertakings offered by the cooperating parties  with elements for minimum import prices and quantitative ceilings. (4) Accordingly  by Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004 (5)  the Commission accepted as a special measure short-term undertakings from: (i) an exporting producer of the product concerned in Ukraine (OJSC ‘Azot’); (ii) an exporting producer in Russia (OJSC MCC Eurochem in respect of goods produced at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot  Russia) and sold by its related company (Cumberland Sound Ltd  British Virgin Islands); (iii) two related Russian exporting producers jointly (Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’ and Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’). (5) In order to provide for an exemption from the anti-dumping duties afforded by the acceptance of the undertakings  Regulation (EC) No 658/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 132/2001 were amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 993/2004. (6) It was stipulated in Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004 that acceptance of the undertakings would be limited to an initial period of six months (the original period) without prejudice to the normal duration of the existing measures and that they would lapse after this period unless the Commission considered it appropriate to extend their period of application. (7) As set out in recital 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004  the continued acceptance of the undertakings would be subject to an appraisal at the end of the six-month period to verify whether the exceptional and negative conditions for end-users in the EU-10 which led to the acceptance of the undertakings still exist. As part of the overall appraisal  an evaluation of the compliance of the companies concerned with their undertakings was also made. B.   APPRAISAL 1.   Content of the current undertakings (8) The existing undertakings offered by the companies oblige them  inter alia  to export in accordance with their traditional pattern of trade to customers in the EU-10 at or above certain minimum import prices (MIPs). These MIPs significantly eliminate the injurious dumping found in the original investigations. Such exports are also to be made within the framework of quantitative ceilings established on the basis of previous  traditional export flows to the EU-10. (9) The terms of the undertakings also oblige the signatory companies to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a monthly report of their sales to the EU-10 (or resales by any related parties in the Community) and to accept verification visits by the Commission. In order  also  to be able to fully monitor the effectiveness of the undertakings  written agreement was received from the exporters’ traditional customers in the EU-10 that they too would allow on-the-spot verification visits at their premises. 2.   Compliance with the current undertakings (10) Verification visits to the exporting producers showed that the companies concerned had observed the MIPs and that the volumes exported to the EU-10 had not exceeded the levels of the quantitative ceilings stipulated in the undertakings. In addition  it was found that the companies were broadly respecting their traditional patterns of trade with individual customers in the EU-10. Moreover  according to the information available  there have been no apparent ‘spill-overs’ from the EU-10 into the EU-15 of imports of the product concerned which had benefited from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties afforded by the undertakings. 3.   Analysis of conditions for continued acceptance of undertakings (11) Analysis of the monthly sales reports submitted to the Commission by the companies concerned backed up by available official statistical data showed that although there had been some convergence in prices  a marked difference still existed between the prices for the product concerned in the EU-10 and the EU-15. In addition  it was noted that import volumes from Russia and Ukraine into the EU-10 had declined since enlargement  however  in view of the fact that the period under examination is one of the ‘low seasons’ for the product concerned  they still remained significant. In addition  as indicated in recital 28 of Regulation (EC) No 993/2004  abnormal increases in export volumes to the EU-10 were found prior to enlargement in 2003 and the first few months of 2004. It is considered that this might also have contributed to the decrease in the quantities imported into the EU-10 following enlargement. C.   CONCLUSION 1.   Acceptance of undertakings (12) Given that the exceptional and negative conditions which prevailed prior to enlargement and which necessitated that the undertakings still exist  and that the terms of the undertakings have been observed during the initial period of their application by the companies concerned  it is considered that the acceptance of undertakings offered by the companies concerned for a further period is justified. (13) As concerns the length of this further period  it is considered that a period of application of more than six months would negate the notion of the undertakings being of a transitional nature  therefore  their acceptance will only be from 21 November 2004 to 20 May 2005 (the final period). (14) With regard to the level of the quantitative ceilings to be applied for the final period  it should be noted that these have been calculated following the same methodology as was used to establish the quantitative ceilings for the original period (however  unlike in the original period when deductions from the traditional volumes were made to take account of abnormal import volumes prior to enlargement  no such adjustments will be made for determining the quantitative ceilings for the final period). Nevertheless  given the trend of increased consumption for this product in the EU-10  a growth factor has been taken into account when establishing the quantitative ceilings for the final period for each exporting producer benefiting from an undertaking. (15) In conformity with Regulation (EC) No 993/2004  the undertakings oblige each individual producing exporter to respect MIPs within framework of import ceilings and in order that the undertakings can be monitored  the exporting producers concerned have also agreed to broadly respect their traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU-10. The exporting producers are also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly  or that the undertakings become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor  the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place  or it may adjust the level of the ceiling  or it may take other remedial action. (16) It is also a condition of the undertakings that if they are breached in any way  the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in their place. (17) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community  meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission. (18) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertakings  when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to an undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 993/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable. 2.   Consultation of Member States (19) In conformity with recital 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004  Member States were consulted on the proposal to accept undertakings for a further period. Certain Member States considered that the level of the MIPs should be raised. It should be recalled  however  that these undertakings are not equivalent to an anti-dumping duty since the MIPs established are at lower levels than would usually be the case. Rather  they serve as a ‘safety net’ below which  prices in the EU-10 should not fall. In view of this and the short-term character of the undertakings  together with the exceptional circumstances under which the undertakings were accepted  revision of the MIP levels at the present time is not considered to be appropriate. 3.   Disclosure to interested parties (20) All interested parties which had previously made themselves known were advised of the intention to accept undertakings. The Community Industry producers’ association stated that it would not oppose such acceptance for a further period provided that this did not adversely affect its situation. A national producer organisation in Poland echoed  however  the views of certain Member States that the level of the MIPs should be raised since the price levels established did not allow its producers to cover their costs. However  for the reasons stated in the previous recital  revision of the MIPs is not considered to be appropriate at the present time. (21) One exporting producer in Russia advised the Commission that it intended to export to the Community via its newly established related trading company in Switzerland. (22) No other comments were received which caused the Commission to alter its views on the matter. D.   REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (23) In Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004  customs authorities were directed to register imports into the Community of the product concerned  originating in Russia and Ukraine  exported by the companies from which undertakings were accepted and for which an exemption from the anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 132/2001 and by Regulation (EC) No 658/2002  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 993/2004  was sought.

1245,COMMISSION  DECISION of 1 March 1990 terminating the review of anti-dumping measures applying to imports of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic and confirming the expiry of the said measures (90/85/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  and in particular Articles 9 and 15 thereof  After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation  Whereas: A. Previous procedure (1) In November 1982 the Commission published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities initiating an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) originating in Czechoslovakia  the German Democratic Republic and Japan (2). In December 1983 a definitive anti-dumping duty was imposed with regard to imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic (3) and an undertaking was accepted on behalf of Japanese exporters with regard to products originating in Japan (4). (2) In July 1988 the Commission published a notice announcing the imminent expiry of the measures in question (5) pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. No request for review concerning the undertaking accepted on behalf of the Japanese exporters was received and the said undertaking duly expired on 16 December 1988 (6). B. Review requests and initiation (3) In September 1988 the Commission received a request for a review of the measures concerning imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic lodged by the Association des Producteurs de Fibres de Verre EuropĂŠen (APFE) on behalf of Community producers representing almost all Community production. The request claimed that the expiry of the anti-dumping measures for imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic would lead again to injury or threat of injury. The main basis of these allegations was the continuous rise of imports at low prices and the risk that expiry of these anti-dumping measures might contribute to a reduction in the current capacity utilization and competitiveness of the European industry. (4) The evidence provided was considered sufficient and the Commission accordingly announced by notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities  its intention to carry out a review of anti-dumping measures of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic (1) and the initiation of that review (2). The investigation period covered the calendar year 1988. During the investigation the parties concerned were able to make known their views and provide all information necessary for the determination of injury related to the expiry of the measures. Pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 the measures remained in force pending the outcome of the investigation. C. Product (5) The products concerned are continuous glass textile fibres (rovings) falling within CN code 7019 10 51 previously Nimexe code 70.20-70. D. Results of the injury investigation (6) The investigation carried out by the Commission services examined the question of whether imports of the goods in question would lead again to injury or threat of injury to Community producers if the current anti-dumping measures were no longer in force. An analysis of the causality between the non-renewal of the anti-dumping measures and the recurrence of injury was  therefore  made by evaluating the present situation and by assessing the foreseeable recurrence of injury or threat of injury after expiry of the said measures. (7) With regard to the present situation it was found that there had been a large increase in demand in the rovings sector due mainly to more applications being found for composite reinforcements in the automotive industry. This favourable market situation was reflected in the Community industry by a higher capacity utilization  increased production  consumption  sales and market share  steadiness of employment and ongoing or imminent investment programmes. On the other hand imports from the countries in question have increased at a lower rate than the consumption in the Community and consequently the market share of Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic in the Community market has decreased. It was also found that prices of the products in question originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic had steadily increased and were always well above the variable duty established in 1983. (8) Concerning the foreseeable recurrence of injury or threat of injury after expiry of the anti-dumping measures  the consequences of expiry of the measures were considered in the light of their effectiveness during the period that the duty was in force. (9) It was established during the investigation that exporters in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic did not only respect the minimum price established in 1983 but continuously exceeded it and increased their export prices between 3 - 5 % annually. It is reasonable therefore  to assume that expiry of the anti-dumping duty would not  on its own  have been enough to substantially alter the situation which prevailed during the five year period nor would it be enough to change the present situation. The anti-dumping measures originally caused exporters in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic to revise their export prices and due to the overall shortages on the reinforcement market  expiry of the duty should not lead to prices falling. (10) Finally with regard to the foreseeable recurrence of injury or threat of injury after expiry of the anti-dumping measures it was confirmed that no additional capacities in the said two countries were to be expected in the near future. (11) In view of the above  it was concluded that no change in the pattern of imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic to the Community of the products in question could be expected in relation to the expiry of the anti-dumping measures. E. Withdrawal of review requested (12) The complainant advised the Commission by letter dated 4 December 1989 that it is withdrawing the request for review mentioned under 3. F. Termination (13) In these circumstances the Commission considers that the review proceeding should be terminated and that the measures remaining in force pending the outcome of the review should lapse forthwith ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by a certain percentage according to whether it is husked or milled rice  minus the cif import price provided that duty does not exceed the rate of the Common Customs Tariff duties. (2) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market or on the Community import market for the product. (3) Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as regards import duties in the rice sector. (4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. They also remain in force in cases where no quotation is available from the source referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 during the two weeks preceding the next periodical fixing. (5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally  the market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties. (6) Application of Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 results in import duties being fixed as set out in the Annexes to this Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Consequently the abovementioned tariff benefit does not apply in Spain and Portugal. Whereas the application of ceilings requires the Community to be regularly informed of the trend of imports of the relevant products originating in these countries; whereas imports should  therefore  be made subject to a system of surveillance; Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on offsetting imports of the products in question against the ceilings at Community level as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation; whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possible re-establishment of customs tariff duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level; Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly swift cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must  in particular  be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to be particularly close since the Commission must be able to take the appropriate measures to re-establish customs tariff duties if one of the ceilings is reached; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products""  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ""other cereals""  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) However  in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets  allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported. (6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

With a view to helping to eradicate bluetongue as rapidly as possible  Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to combat outbreaks of bluetongue. (2) Article 3(5) of Decision 90/424/EEC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the Community's financial contribution. (3) The payment of a Community financial contribution towards emergency measures to combat bluetongue is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3). That Regulation applies to Community financial contributions granted to Member States in respect of eligible expenditure as defined therein for certain disease eradication measures in the situations referred to in Article 3(1) of Decision 90/424/EEC. (4) An outbreak of bluetongue occurred in Germany in 2007. The emergence of that disease represents a serious risk to the Community's livestock population. (5) Accordingly  Germany took the necessary emergency measures in order to avoid the spread of bluetongue. (6) On 28 November 2007  Germany provided the financial information required prior to the granting of Community financial support in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.

1259,20.3.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 74/26 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 237/2009 of 19 March 2009 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to milk and milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (single CMO Regulation) (1)  and in particular Article 164(2) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 162(1)b of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(p) and listed in Part XVI of Annex I to that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these goods are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to that Regulation. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) In accordance with the second paragraph  subparagraph (a) of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed for a period of the same duration as that for which refunds are fixed for the same products exported unprocessed. (4) Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lays down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (5) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (6) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products. (7) Article 100(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.

(2) The increased use of biofuels in Community transport forms part of a raft of measures designed to meet the Community’s environmental commitments. Promoting the use of biofuels may open up a new market for the agricultural products of the Member States. (3) Germany has significant intervention stocks of rye for which it is proving difficult to find markets and which should therefore be disposed of. To this end  sales on the Community market may be organised by tendering procedure with a view to processing the rye into bioethanol and its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community  within the meaning of Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport (3). (4) To take account of the situation on the Community market  provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition  provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price. (5) It is also important for the German intervention agency’s notification to the Commission to maintain the anonymity of the tenderers. (6) With a view to modernising management  the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail. (7) To enable checks on the particular destination of the stocks covered by tendering procedures  provision should be made for specific monitoring of  on the one hand  the delivery of the rye and its processing into bioethanol and  on the other hand  its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community. To permit this monitoring  application of the procedures laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention (4) and Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding  movement and monitoring of such products (5) respectively should be made compulsory. (8) To guarantee proper performance  tenderers should be asked to lodge a security which  in view of the nature of the operations concerned  should be fixed by derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93  in particular as regards the conditions for its release.

(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that  to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported  the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds. (3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (4) Under Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph.

Therefore  care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables  quotas should be fixed for each product.

(12) Owing to the market situation  in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports  the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A1  A2 and A3 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question. (13) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund  taking account in particular of their perishability.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation  exported in the natural state  are being fixed  account must be taken of: - the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade  - marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community  as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination  - the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market  - the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty  and - the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market  and - the economic aspect of the proposed exports. (3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation  and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of: (a) prices ruling on third country markets; (b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports; (c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries  account being taken  where appropriate  of subsidies granted by those countries; and (d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices. (4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination. (5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may  however  remain at the same level for more than four weeks. (6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2279/2002(4)  the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5)  as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(6)  however  this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community. (7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(7)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(8)  laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products. (8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account. (9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that  to the extent necessary for economically significant exports  the products exported by the Community may be covered by export refunds  within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature  the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed  based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned. (4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Tomatoes  oranges  lemons  table grapes  apples and peaches of classes Extra  I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities. (8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community exports  it is appropriate to fix the A1 and B export refunds. (9) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished.

1338,COMMISSION DECISION of 29 July 1998 terminating the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru (notified under document number C(1998) 2410) (98/478/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  and in particular Article 14(1) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: I. PROCEDURE (1) In September 1997  the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious subsidisation of imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru. (2) The complaint was lodged by Xantoflor SA (Monteagudo  Spain) which represents more than 25 % of Community production of the product concerned  and was supported by Alchim SA and Sofral SA (Illkirch  France). Together these producers represent a major proportion of Community production of cochineal carmine as defined in Article 10(8) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 as none of the other producers expressed its opinion on the complaint. (3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of countervailable subsidies on cochineal carmine and material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. (4) Accordingly  the Commission  after consultation  announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Community of cochineal carmine falling within CN code ex 3205 00 00 originating in Peru. (5) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. II. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) Of the three producers that supported the complaint  only Xantoflor SA and Alchim SA supplied the Commission with a comprehensive reply to its questionnaire and thus cooperated with the investigation. These producers account for more than 25 % of total Community production of the product concerned. As no Community producers opposed the present investigation these companies' output thus constitutes a major proportion of the Community production  as defined in Article 10(8) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97. (7) In the course of the investigation Xantoflor SA informed the Commission  by letter of 11 June 1998  that it formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru as it had become apparent that circumstances had changed to the extent that the Community industry and in particular Xantoflor may not have been suffering material injury. (8) As Xantoflor SA and Alchim SA together constitute the Community industry and the output of Alchim SA represents but a small proportion of the total Community production of cochineal carmine  the complaint would not have the support of a major proportion of the Community producers  even if Alchim SA continued to support it. (9) In accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97  when the complainant withdraws its complaint the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would be against the termination of the proceedings. (10) Interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the proceeding  were given the opportunity to comment and did not raise any objection. (11) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection. (12) In these circumstances  the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru should be terminated without imposition of protective measures ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) In order to ensure compliance with the provisions relating to the quantity limits on catches of stocks subject to quotas  the Commission must fix the date by which catches made by vessels flying the flag of a Member State are deemed to have exhausted the quota allocated. (3) According to the information received by the Commission  catches of blue whiting in the waters of ICES divisions Vb (EC waters)  VI  VII  XII and XIV by vessels flying the flag of Germany or registered in Germany have exhausted the quota allocated for 2001. Germany has prohibited fishing for this stock from 23 May 2001. This date should be adopted in this Regulation also ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1340,28.9.2010 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 253/42 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 850/2010 of 27 September 2010 initiating a ‘new exporter’ review of Council Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People’s Republic of China  repealing the duty with regard to imports from one exporter in this country and making these imports subject to registration THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (‘the basic Regulation’) (1) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   REQUEST FOR A REVIEW (1) The Commission has received an application for a ‘new exporter’ review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. The application was lodged by TRL China Ltd (‘the applicant’)  an exporting producer in the People’s Republic of China (‘the country concerned’). B.   PRODUCT (2) The product under review is chemically bonded  unfired magnesia bricks  whose magnesia component contains at least 80 % MgO  whether or not containing magnesite  originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the product concerned’)  currently falling within CN codes ex 6815 91 00  ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90 (TARIC codes 6815910010  6815991020 and 6815999020). C.   EXISTING MEASURES (3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 (2) under which imports into the Union of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China  including the product concerned produced by the applicant  are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 39 9 % with the exception of several companies specifically mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates. D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW (4) The applicant alleges that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively claims individual treatment in conformity with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. It further alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Union during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based  i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (‘the original investigation period’) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the above mentioned anti-dumping measures. (5) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Union after the end of the original investigation period. E.   PROCEDURE (6) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. (7) Having examined the evidence available  the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review  pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. Upon receipt of the claim mentioned below under recital 13  it will be determined whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively whether the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. If so  the applicant’s individual margin of dumping shall be calculated and  should dumping be found  the level of the duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Union should be subject shall be determined. (8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established  it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005. (a)   Questionnaires (9) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant. (b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings (10) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. (11) Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. (12) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the parties making themselves known within the period provided for by the present Regulation. (c)   Market economy treatment/individual treatment (13) In the event that the applicant provides sufficient evidence that it operates under market economy conditions  i.e. that it meets the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation  normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. For this purpose  duly substantiated claims must be submitted within the specific time limit set in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. The Commission will send claim forms to the applicant  as well as to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China. This claim form may also be used by the applicant to claim individual treatment  i.e. that it meets the criteria laid down in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. (d)   Selection of the market economy country (14) In the event that the applicant is not granted market economy treatment but fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation  an appropriate market economy country will be used for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People’s Republic of China in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. The Commission envisages using the United States of America again for this purpose as was done in the investigation which led to the imposition of measures on imports of the product concerned from the People’s Republic of China. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in Article 4(2) of this Regulation. (15) Furthermore  in the event that the applicant is granted market economy treatment  the Commission may  if necessary  also use findings concerning the normal value established in an appropriate market-economy country  e.g. for the purpose of replacing any unreliable cost or price elements in the People’s Republic of China which are needed in establishing the normal value  if reliable required data are not available in the People’s Republic of China. The Commission envisages using the United States of America also for this purpose. F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (16) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Union by the applicant. At the same time  such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation  in order to ensure that  should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant  anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding. G.   TIME LIMITS (17) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: — interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  — interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission  — interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of the United States of America which  in the event that the applicant will not be granted market economy treatment  is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People’s Republic of China  — the applicant should submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy treatment. H.   NON-COOPERATION (18) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (19) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made  in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially  and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA (20) Please note that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3). J.   HEARING OFFICER (21) Please note that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence  they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services  offering  where necessary  mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this proceeding  in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file  confidentiality  extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.

1351,10.12.2013 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 329/1 DIRECTIVE 2013/54/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 November 2013 concerning certain flag State responsibilities for compliance with and enforcement of the Maritime Labour Convention  2006 (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  and in particular Article 100(2) thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1)  After consulting the Committee of the Regions  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2)  Whereas: (1) Union action in the field of maritime transport aims  inter alia  to improve the shipboard living and working conditions of seafarers  security and safety at sea and to prevent pollution caused by maritime accidents. (2) The Union is aware of the fact that most accidents at sea are directly caused by human factors  especially fatigue. (3) One of the main objectives of the maritime safety policy of the Union is to eradicate substandard shipping. (4) On 23 February 2006  the International Labour Organisation (ILO)  desiring to create a single  coherent and up-to-date instrument that also embodies the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions  adopted the Maritime Labour Convention  2006 (MLC 2006). (5) According to Article VIII thereof  the MLC 2006 is to come into force 12 months after the date on which there have been registered ratifications by at least 30 Members of the ILO with a total share in the world gross tonnage of ships of 33 %. This condition was fulfilled on 20 August 2012  and MLC 2006 therefore entered into force on 20 August 2013. (6) Council Decision 2007/431/EC (3) authorised the Member States to ratify MLC 2006  and Member States are urged to do so as soon as possible. (7) MLC 2006 sets out minimum global standards to ensure the right of all seafarers to decent living and working conditions  irrespective of their nationality and irrespective of the flag of the ships on which they serve  and to establish a level playing field. (8) Various parts of MLC 2006 have been introduced into different Union instruments both as regards flag State and port State obligations. The aim of this Directive is to introduce certain compliance and enforcement provisions  envisaged in Title 5 of MLC 2006  which relate to those parts of MLC 2006 in respect of which the required compliance and enforcement provisions have not yet been adopted. Those parts correspond to the elements set out in the Annex to Council Directive 2009/13/EC (4). (9) Directive 2009/13/EC implements the Agreement concluded by the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF) on the Maritime Labour Convention  2006 (‘the Agreement’)  annexed thereto. This Directive is without prejudice to Directive 2009/13/EC and should therefore ensure compliance with more favourable provisions of Union law in conformity with that Directive. (10) Although Directive 2009/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) governs flag State responsibilities  incorporating the voluntary IMO Member States audit scheme into Union law  and introducing the certification of quality of national maritime authorities  a separate Directive covering the maritime labour standards would be more appropriate and would more clearly reflect the different purposes and procedures  without affecting Directive 2009/21/EC. (11) Directive 2009/21/EC applies to IMO Conventions. In any event  Member States could develop  implement and maintain a quality management system for the operational parts of the flag State-related activities of their maritime administration falling within the scope of this Directive. (12) Member States should ensure the effective discharge of their obligations as flag States with respect to the implementation  by ships flying their flag  of the relevant parts of MLC 2006. In establishing an effective system for monitoring mechanisms  including inspections  a Member State could  where appropriate  grant authorisation to public institutions  or to other organisations within the meaning of Regulation 5.1.2 of MLC 2006  under the conditions set out therein. (13) According to Article 2(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) the mandate of the European Maritime Safety Agency includes  as a core task  that the Agency should work with the Member States to provide  at the request of a Member State  appropriate information in order to support the monitoring of recognised organisations acting on behalf of that Member State  without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the flag State. (14) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather  by reason of the scale and effects of the action  be better achieved at the level of the Union  the Union may adopt measures  in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality  as set out in that Article  this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (15) Under no circumstances should the application of this Directive lead to a reduction in the level of protection currently enjoyed by seafarers under Union law ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These prices and duties have been last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 592/2009 (4).

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

1356,COUNCIL DECISION of 27 June 1996 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Germany (96/421/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular Article 104c (6) thereof  Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission  Having regard to the observations made by Germany  Whereas the second stage for achieving economic and monetary union started on 1 January 1994; whereas Article 109e (4) of the Treaty lays down that  in the second stage  Member States shall endeavour to avoid excessive government deficits; Whereas there is an excessive deficit procedure which provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit and  after the excessive deficit has been corrected  for the abrogation of that decision; whereas the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of that procedure; whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (1) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the said Protocol; Whereas the application of the excessive deficit procedure resulted in a Council Decision of 26 September 1994 that an excessive deficit existed in Germany; whereas the Council decided  on 10 July 1995  to abrogate that Decision; Whereas Article 104c (5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur; whereas the Commission addressed such an opinion on Germany to the Council in May 1996; whereas according to this opinion: (a) Germany reported information on its budgetary situation to the Commission by March 1996. Thereupon  the Commission  in accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure  provided the statistical data for the application of the said Protocol; (b) in accordance with Article 104c (3) of the Treaty  the Commission prepared  in April 1996  a report on Germany which takes account of the relevant factors; (c) in accordance with Article 104c (4) of the Treaty  the Monetary Committee formulated an opinion on the report of the Commission; (d) the Commission considers that an excessive deficit exists in Germany; Whereas Article 104c (6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before the Council decides  after an overall assessment  whether an excessive deficit exists; whereas this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions: Germany has made considerable efforts to cope with the expenditure needs created by unification. The government deficit to GDP ratio was gradually reduced  with the temporary exception of 1993  and stood at 2 5 % of GDP in 1994. However  the decline of the deficit in Germany was reversed in 1995  when the deficit rose to 3 5 % of GDP  only partly due due to weaker growth. The Government deficit was reported by the German Federal Government  in February 1996  to be 3 6 % for 1996. The deficit as forecast by the Commission services for the year 1996 is 3 9 % of GDP. The planned deficit for 1996 is therefore in excess of the Treaty reference value; Whereas  regarding the medium-term economic and budgetary position of Germany  the evolution of the gross Government debt as a ratio of GDP suggests that the ratio  having reached 58 1 % in 1995  is projected to increase further by several percentage points in 1996; Whereas Article 3 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure lays down that the governments of the Member States are responsible for the deficits of general government as defined in the first indent of Article 2 of that Protocol; Whereas a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated  in accordance with the provisions of Article 104c (12) of the Treaty  when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has  in the view of the Council  been corrected ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

1366,Commission Regulation (EC) No 283/2004 of 18 February 2004 initiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of countervailing measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999 on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India by imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consigned from Brazil and from Israel  whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not and making such imports subject to registration THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1973/2002(2)  (the basic Regulation)  and in particular Article 23(2) and Article 24(3) and (5) thereof  After having consulted the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. REQUEST (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 23(2) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the countervailing measures imposed on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film (PET film) originating in India. (2) The request was lodged on 6 January 2004 by the following Community producers: DuPont Teijin Films  Mitsubishi Polyester Film GmbH and Nuroll SpA. B. PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is PET film originating in India  normally declared under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (the product concerned). These codes are given for information only. (4) The product under investigation is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consigned from Brazil and from Israel (the product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned. C. EXISTING MEASURES (5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are countervailing measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999(3). D. GROUNDS (6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the countervailing measures on imports of PET film originating in India are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Brazil and via Israel. (7) The evidence submitted is as follows: The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from India  Brazil and Israel to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned  and that there appears to be insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the transhipment of PET film originating in India via Brazil and via Israel. (8) Furthermore  the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing countervailing measures on the product concerned are being undermined in terms of quantities. Significant volumes of imports of PET film from Brazil and from Israel appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in India. (9) Finally  the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the imported PET film still benefits from the subsidies as established in the original investigation. (10) Should circumvention practices covered by Article 23 of the basic Regulation  other than transhipment  be identified in the course of the investigation  the investigation may cover these practices also. E. PROCEDURE (11) In the light of the above  the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 23 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of PET film consigned from Brazil and from Israel  whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not  subject to registration  in accordance with Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation. (a) Questionnaires (12) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Brazil and Israel  to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in India  to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures or which are listed in the request  and to the authorities of India  Brazil and Israel. Information  as appropriate  may also be sought from the Community industry. (13) In any event  all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith  but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and  if necessary  request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation  given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties. (14) The authorities of India  Brazil and Israel will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request. (b) Collection of information and holding of hearings (15) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. (c) Exemption from registration of imports or measures (16) In accordance with Article 23(3) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention. (17) The possible circumvention takes place outside the Community. Article 23 of the basic Regulation is aiming at countering circumvention practices without affecting operators which can prove that they are not involved in such practices  but it does not contain a specific provision providing for the treatment of producers in the countries concerned which could establish that they are not involved in circumvention practices. Therefore  it appears necessary to introduce a possibility for producers concerned to request an exemption from the registration of imports of their exported products or from measures on these imports. (18) Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should apply for it and submit any requested questionnaire reply within the appropriate time limits  in order for it to be established that they are not circumventing the countervailing duties within the meaning of Article 23(1) of the basic Regulation. Importers could still benefit from exemption from registration or measures to the extent that their imports are from producers which are granted such an exemption  and in accordance with Article 23(3) of the basic Regulation. F. REGISTRATION (19) Pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that  should the investigation result in findings of circumvention  countervailing duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from Brazil and from Israel. G. TIME LIMITS (20) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: - interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  - interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. (21) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation. H. NON-COOPERATION (22) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (23) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made  in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation  of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate  or cooperates only partially  and use of the facts available is made  the result may be less favourable than if it had cooperated ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds. (3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products""  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ""other cereals""  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) However  in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets  allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported. (6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 10 February 2010  the United Kingdom requested to extend the period of validity of the authorisation provided for by Council Decision 2007/250/EC of 16 April 2007 authorising the United Kingdom to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (2). (2) The Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 11 January 2010 of the request made by Germany  and by letter dated 9 March 2010 of the requests made by Italy  Austria and the United Kingdom. The Commission informed Germany by letter dated 12 January 2010 and Italy  Austria and the United Kingdom  by letters dated 11 March 2010  that it had all the information it considered necessary for the appraisal of the requests. (3) The person liable for the payment of VAT pursuant to Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC is the taxable person supplying the goods. The purpose of the derogations requested by Germany  Italy and Austria is to place that liability on the taxable person to whom the supplies are made  but only under certain conditions and only in relation to particular products  notably mobile telephones and integrated circuit devices. (4) A significant number of traders in particular products  notably mobile telephones and integrated circuit devices  evade paying VAT to the tax authorities after selling their products. Their customers  however  are entitled to a tax deduction as they are in possession of a valid invoice. In the most aggressive cases of such tax evasion the same goods are  via a ‘carousel’ scheme  supplied several times without payment of VAT to the tax authorities. By designating the person to whom the goods are supplied as the person liable for the payment of VAT in such cases  the derogation would eliminate the opportunity to engage in that form of tax evasion. It would not affect the amount of VAT due. (5) For the purposes of ensuring the effective operation of the derogation and preventing tax evasion from being shifted to other products or towards the retail level  Germany  Italy and Austria should introduce appropriate control and reporting obligations. The Commission should be informed of the specific measures adopted in view of monitoring the operation of the derogation. (6) The measure is proportionate to the objectives pursued since it is not intended to apply generally  but only to specific groups of products  where there is a high risk of tax evasion and where the scale of tax evasion has resulted in considerable tax losses. Moreover  the use of a reverse charge mechanism implies less risk of shifting of fraud towards the retail trade of the products in question  as mobile phones are generally supplied by large phone companies and as the measure is applicable to integrated circuits in a state prior to integration into end-user products. (7) In principle  the authorisation shall be valid only for a short period  because it cannot be established with certainty that the objectives of the measure will be achieved nor can the impact of the measure on the functioning of the VAT systems within those Member States who apply it  or in other Member States  be gauged in advance. (8) The United Kingdom should be allowed to continue to apply its existing special measure until the date of expiry of the authorisations granted to Germany  Italy and Austria. (9) The derogation has no negative impact on the Union’s own resources accruing from VAT ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASSF) has been notified on repeated occasions in 2007  2008 and 2009 that pears originating from Turkey were found with levels of amitraz exceeding the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) for this pesticide. The latest information received from the German authorities on 21 October 2009  indicated that in the most recent analysis amitraz was found at levels that largely exceeded the ARfD. (3) Given the high level of risk to which European consumers may be exposed  Member States should control at least 10 percent of consignments of pears originating from Turkey for the presence of amitraz at import. Consignments already on the market should also be subject to official controls. (4) Member States should inform the Commission of all testing results. Unfavourable results should be reported through RASFF. (5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the increased level of official controls on imports of certain feed and food of non-animal origin and amending Decision 2006/504/EC (3) requires Member States to carry out an increased level of controls at import on pears originating from Turkey  for the purposes of verifying the presence of amitraz on 10 % of all consignments of that commodity. As the control measure in question will be applicable as from 25 January 2010  it is appropriate to establish a duration of the measures laid down in this decision so as to avoid overlaps with the control measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 669/2009. (6) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health  animal health or the environment  where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually. (7) Given the urgency it is appropriate to adopt these emergency measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.

The amount of the anti-dumping duty is equal to the fixed amount of EUR 32 6 per tonne of dry net weight. (2) In view of the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community on 23 July 2002  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 963/2002 (3)  decided that anti-dumping measures which had been adopted pursuant to Decision No 2277/96/ECSC and which were still in force on 23 July 2002 were to be continued and governed by the provisions of the basic Regulation with effect from 24 July 2002. 2.   Current procedure (3) On 11 December 2002  the Commission announced  by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities  (4)  the initiation of an interim review of the definitive anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm (hereafter ‘coke 80+’ or ‘the product concerned’) originating in the PRC in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation and commenced an investigation. (4) The proceeding was initiated following a request lodged by Eucoke-EEIG (the ‘applicant’) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm. The applicant alleged that dumping in respect of the PRC had continued and even increased and that the existing measures would no longer be sufficient to counteract the injurious effects of dumping. The evidence contained in the request for a review was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of the investigation. (5) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters  the importers and the users known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country concerned  the applicant Community industry and the other known Community producers about the initiation of the interim review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. 3.   Suspension of measures (6) It is recalled that during the investigation of the present proceeding a number of interested parties provided information on a change in market conditions after the end of the investigation period (1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002)  thus fulfilling the conditions required under Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation to justify the suspension of the measures currently in force. (7) The investigation showed that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping measures were met. Therefore  by Commission Decision No 264/2004EC (5)  the anti-dumping duty applicable to imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the PRC was suspended for a period of nine months. 4.   Withdrawal of the application (8) By letter of 15 December 2003 to the Commission  Eucoke-EEIG formally withdrew its application. (9) With regard to the fact that the investigation has not brought to light any consideration showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest  it is considered that the present proceeding should be terminated in accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation. 5.   Form of the measures (10) However  during the investigation  it was found that there was a need to clarify the scope of application of the existing measures in view of the difficulties faced by an economic operator with respect to the application of the measures in force. Indeed  it was found that anti-dumping duties were being collected by the customs authorities of one Member State on shipments of coke destined for use in blast furnaces  which are not concerned by the anti-dumping measures  and comprise only a small part of the product concerned. In order to ensure a more efficient and uniform enforcement of the measures  the exemption provided for in Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC for exports which are a mixture of coke of coal in pieces of smaller size than the product concerned and coke of coal in pieces not exceeding 100 mm is replaced by an exemption covering a mixture in which the proportion of coke exceeding 80 mm does not constitute more than 20 % of the mixed shipment. In addition  the ISO standard should be used as the method of measurement. 6.   Conclusion (11) The interim review should be terminated. The scope of application of the existing measures should be clarified ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) An intervention threshold for apples was set for the 1999/2000 marketing year in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1541/1999(3).

(2) In Member States which do not have sea ports  tenderers for cereals put up for sale are penalized by higher transport costs. As a result of these additional costs  cereals are more difficult to export from those Member States  which results in particular in longer intervention storage and additional costs to the Community budget. Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 therefore provides for the possibility  in certain cases  of financing the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the place of exit  in order to make the tenders comparable. (3) The Croation ports of Rijeka and Split were traditional ports of exit for the countries of central Europe before their accession to the Union. Rijeka and Split should therefore be included among the places of exit that can be considered when calculating the refundable transport costs for exports. (4) In order to simplify and harmonise the procedures for the placing on sale of cereals for export  the procedure for releasing the guarantees referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should be clarified  based on Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3)  especially as regards the proof that the import customs formalities have been completed in a third country. (5) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Furthermore  the Annex of Commission Decision 2000/159/EC of 8 February 2000 on the provisional approval of residue plants of third countries according to Council Directive 96/23/EC(4)  as last amended by Commission Decision 2000/675/EC(5)  indicates the third countries which have submitted a plan  setting out the guarantees which it offers as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in Annex I of Directive 96/23/EC. (3) Consequently  when the guarantees referred to in recital 2 are not provided  the imports of aquaculture products shall not be authorised  even if they are in compliance with the Council Directive 91/493/EC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(6)  as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(7). (4) Since Commission Decision 97/296/EC(8)  as amended by Decision 2001/40/EC(9)  lists the countries and territories from which importation of fishery products for human consumption is authorised  it is necessary to modify this Decision to include the requirement that the import of aquaculture products shall only be authorised from those third countries listed in both Decisions: 97/296/EC and 2000/159/EC. (5) However  as Commission Decision 95/328/EC of 25 July 1995 establishing health certification for fishery products from third countries which are not yet covered by a specific decision(10)  as last amended by Decision 2001/67/EC(11)  provides a transitional period for the up-dating of the model of health certification  it is necessary to provide a derogation in the application of the Decision 2000/159/EC for aquaculture products  during this transitional period.

(2) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza  there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other poultry holdings within that Member State  but also to other Member States and to third countries through trade in live poultry or their products. (3) Council Directive 2005/94/EC (2) introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak have to be immediately implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus. (4) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures  including emergency measures. Pursuant to Article 4(2) of that Decision  Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate avian influenza. (5) Article 4(3) first and second indents of Decision 2009/470/EC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the financial contribution from the Union. (6) The payment of a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to eradicate avian influenza is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3). (7) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in Germany  Italy and the Netherlands in 2011. Germany  Italy and the Netherlands took measures in accordance with Directive 2005/94/EC to combat those outbreaks. (8) The authorities of Germany  Italy and the Netherlands were able to demonstrate through reports provided in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and continuous submission of information on the development of the disease situation that they have efficiently implemented the control measures provided for in Directive 2005/94/EC. (9) The authorities of Germany  Italy and the Netherlands have therefore fulfilled their technical and administrative obligations with regard to the measures provided for in Article 4(2) of Decision 2009/470/EC and Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.

(3) As far as wheat and rye flour  groats and meal are concerned  when the refund on these products is being calculated  account must be taken of the quantities of cereals required for their manufacture. These quantities were fixed in Regulation (EC) No 1501/95. (4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.

(2) A notification concerning the placing on the market of two genetically modified maize products (Zea mays L.  line MON 863 and hybrid MON 863 × MON 810) was submitted by Monsanto SA to the competent authority of Germany. (3) The notification covers importation and use as for any other maize grains including feed but not food use  with the exception of the cultivation in the Community of varieties derived from the MON 863 transformation event as well as with the exception of the cultivation in the Community of MON 863 × MON 810 hybrids. (4) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2001/18/EC  the competent authority of Germany prepared an assessment report  which was submitted to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States. That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of MON 863 maize as well as MON 863 × MON 810 maize should be withheld  if specific conditions are fulfilled. (5) The competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product. (6) The opinion adopted on 2 April 2004 by the European Food Safety Authority  in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law  establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (2)  concluded  from all evidence provided  that Zea mays L. line MON 863 is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed use. The European Food Safety Authority also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the consent holder is in line with the intended uses of MON 863. (7) Concerning the hybrid MON 863 × MON 810  the European Food Safety Authority considered that it is scientifically valid to use the data from the single lines MON 863 and MON 810 to support the safety assessment of the hybrid MON 863 × MON 810  but decided regarding the need for confirmatory data for the safety assessment of the hybrid itself  to request a 90-day sub-chronic rat study with the maize hybrid in order to complete its safety assessment. Thus  only the safety assessment of the maize line MON 863 has been finalised. (8) An examination of each of the objections in the light of Directive 2001/18/EC  of the information submitted in the notification and of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority  discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of Zea mays L. line MON 863 will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment. (9) A unique identifier should be assigned to the MON 863 maize for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4). (10) Adventitious or technically unavoidable traces of genetically modified organisms in products are exempted from labelling and traceability requirements in accordance with thresholds established under Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (5). (11) In light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority  it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended uses with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems  environments or geographical areas. (12) Prior to the placing on the market of the product  the necessary measures to ensure its labelling and traceability at all stages of its placing on the market  including verification by appropriate validated detection methodology  should be applicable. (13) The measures provided for in this Decision are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them in accordance with Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6) the measures should be adopted by the Commission ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) In the light of the information available to the Commission today  there is a risk that the indicative quantities laid down for the current export period for tomatoes will shortly be exceeded.

(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination  quantities  qualities and presentations. (6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However  that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff. (2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market.

Whereas  under Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86  the minimum price to be paid to producers is to be determined on the basis of  firstly  the minimum price applying during the previous marketing year  secondly  the movement of basic prices in the fruit and vegetable sector and  thirdly  the need to ensure the normal marketing of fresh products for the various uses; Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 lays down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid; whereas account must  in particular  be taken of the aid fixed for the previous marketing year adjusted to take account of changes in the minimum price to be paid to producers  the non-member country price and  if necessary  the pattern of processing cost assessed on a flat-rate basis; whereas  in respect of tomato concentrates  preserved whole peeled tomatoes and tomato juices the volume of imports makes the non-member country price unrepresentative; whereas the production aid for these products must be calculated by reference to a price based on the Community market price; Whereas Article 1 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 989/84 (6) fixed as the guarantee threshold for each year a quantity of processed tomato products corresponding to 4 700 000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes; whereas Community production calculated in accordance with Article 2 (2) of that Regulation exceeds the threshold for the 1985/86 marketing year and the production of each group of tomato-based products is higher than the quantity specified in the second subparagraph of Article 1 (1) of the same Regulation; whereas the production aid for the 1986/87 marketing year must be reduced for such products pursuant to Article 2 (1) of the same Regulation; Whereas  as regards Greece  pursuant to Article 103 of the Act of Accession of Greece and until the first move towards alignment of prices  the minimum price to be paid to Greek producers is to be established on the basis of prices paid in Greece to national producers  over the reference period defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 41/81 (7); whereas that price must be aligned with the level of the common prices pursuant to Article 59 of that Act; Whereas  as regards Greece  the said Article 103 and Council Regulation (EEC) No 990/84 (8) lay down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid; Whereas the minimum price to be paid to producers in Spain and Portugal and the production aid for the products obtained shall be determined as provided for in Articles 118 and 304 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas the representative period for determining the minimum price for tomatoes intended for certain uses is laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 461/86 of 25 February laying down  on account of the accession of Spain and Portugal  rules on the production aid system in respect of processed fruit and vegetables (9); whereas as a consequence of Article 1 (2) of that Regulation no production aid can be paid during the transitional period for preserved whole peeled tomatoes and frozen whole tomatoes obtained from the San Marzano variety grown in Portugal; Whereas Articles 118 (3) (b) and 304 (3) (b) of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal provide that the grant of production aid to tomato-based products is to be limited to specific quantities; whereas to ensure equitable allocation of raw material to each of the production regions of the Community  it should be laid down that tomatoes grown in a specific region only attract production aid when processed in that region; Whereas Article 4 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1709/84 (1) provides that  inter alia  during the 1986/87 marketing year the production aid to be paid for tomato concentrate packed in containers with a weight  including immediate packing  of less than 1 5 kilograms is to be increased by a percentage; whereas this increase is based on the processing cost involved in the packing; whereas these costs are considered as identical in all Member States; whereas the increase should also be identical in all Member States;

(2) Each year the Commission has to determine essential uses for these controlled substances  the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them. (3) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer  hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’  sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party. (4) Decision XV/8 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A  B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the seventh Meeting of the Parties  subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the sixth Meeting of the Parties  Decision VII/11 and Decision XI/15 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. (5) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the 12th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free metered-dose inhalers (MDIs)  Austria  Belgium  Czech Republic  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Ireland  Luxembourg  Norway  Portugal  the Netherlands  Sweden and the United Kingdom have notified the United Nations Environment Programme (2) that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of specific short-acting beta agonist CFC-MDIs. Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have reduced the demand for CFCs in the Community. In addition  Article 4(6) prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1). (6) The Commission published a notice (3) on 11 July 2003 to those companies in the Community (15) that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2004 and a further notification to companies in the 10 new Member States on 11 May 2004 (4)  and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances in 2004. (7) Commission Decision 2004/209/EC of 28 January 2004 on the allocation of quantities of controlled substances allowed for essential uses in the Community in 2004 pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) should be amended in order to take account of the inclusion of specific quantities of ozone depleting substances required for essential uses in the 10 new Member States from 1 May 2004. (8) In the interests of legal clarity and transparency Decision 2004/209/EC should therefore be replaced.

They have a salt content by weight of 1 2 % to 1 9 %. The product is deep-frozen and has to be stored at a temperature of lower than -18 Â°C to ensure conservation for at least one year"". (2) This classification was adopted for the following reasons: ""Classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 0207  0207 14 and 0207 14 10. The product is chicken meat frozen for long-term conservation. The addition of salt does not alter the character of the product as frozen meat of heading 0207"". (3) Following publication of the above Regulation on 9 July 2002(7)  all binding tariff information (BTIs) previously issued by Member States classifying the products concerned as salted meat of heading 0210 ceased to be valid. (4) Based on this Regulation  some Member States later issued BTIs for frozen products of the same kind containing 2 % to 2 7 % salt under heading 0207. (5) A number of cases subsequently came to light in which Germany had issued BTIs classifying frozen products of this kind containing between 1 9 % and 3 % by weight of salt under heading 0210. (6) In so doing  Germany failed to take account of the fact that the classification regulation constitutes the application of a general rule to a particular case  and thus contains guidance on the interpretation of the rule which can be applied by the authority responsible for the classification of an identical or similar product. (7) Products also consisting of boneless chicken cuts which have been frozen for long-term conservation and have a salt content of 1 9 % to 3 % are similar to the products covered by Regulation (EC) No 1223/2002. The addition of salt in such quantities is not such as to alter the products' character as frozen poultry meat of heading 0207. (8) In order to safeguard equality between operators  which would be endangered if like cases were not treated alike  and to ensure uniform application of the CN  the BTIs issued by Germany on frozen poultry meat containing between 1 9 % and 3 % salt  listed in the annex  must be withdrawn. (9) Pursuant to Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2454/93  the holder of the BTIs concerned may make use of the possibility of invoking BTIs which have ceased to be valid during a given period.

However  that Directive permits derogations from that rule  provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms. (2) Commission Decision 2003/249/EC (2) authorises Member States to provide for temporary derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC to permit the import of plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.)  intended for planting  other than seeds  originating in Chile. (3) The circumstances justifying the authorisation provided for in Decision 2003/249/EC are still present and there is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions. (4) By Commission Directive 2008/64/EC (3) Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds was removed from point (c) of Section II of Part A of Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC. Therefore this organism should no longer be included in the Annex of Decision 2003/249/EC. (5) Based on the experience gained with the application of Decision 2003/249/EC it is appropriate to extend the period of validity of that authorisation for 10 years.

This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the 2001/02 marketing year.

The special situation of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the refunds  and therefore to apply Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 enabling the refund amount to be fixed by tendering procedure. (3) It should be stated that the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 299/95(4)  apply to this invitation to tender.

That Decision initially applied until 31 March 2009 but this period of application was extended until 30 November 2009 by Commission Decision 2009/297/EC of 26 March 2009 amending Decision 2008/866/EC as regards its period of application (3). (2) The Peruvian authorities have provided information concerning the corrective measures put in place to improve control of the production of bivalve molluscs intended for export to the Community. (3) A Commission inspection mission has been carried out from 7 to 18 September 2009 in order to evaluate the control systems in place governing the production of bivalve molluscs and fishery products intended for export to the European Union. (4) The inspection visit verified that the Peruvian authorities are putting in place the corrective measures contained in the information they provided after the outbreak of hepatitis A. They are  in particular  completely reviewing the classification of the production areas and will also review the monitoring of the production areas as regards the sampling procedure and its frequency. These revisions are still ongoing. (5) In order to protect the health of consumers it is necessary to maintain the protective measures provided by Decision 2008/866/EC until the Peruvian authorities have completed the implementation of the corrective measures and the Commission has carried out a further inspection on the spot. It is therefore appropriate to extend the application of Decision 2008/866/EC until 30 November 2010  without prejudice of the power of the Commission to modify  repeal or extend those measures in the light of any new information related to the evolution of the situation in Peru and of the outcome of inspections by its services.

1501,30.5.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 138/7 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 583/2007 of 29 May 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 as regards the booking of imports of maize and sorghum and the communications to be made by the Member States concerned THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1)  and in particular Article 12(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) Under the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations  the Community undertook  as from the 1995/96 marketing year  to open reduced-tariff quotas (hereinafter abatimento quotas) for imports into Spain of two million tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum respectively and for imports into Portugal of 500 000 tonnes of maize. Detailed rules for the application of abatimento tariff quotas were laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 of 26 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of tariff quotas for imports of maize and sorghum into Spain and imports of maize into Portugal (2). (2) To ensure the proper application of these quotas  the quantities of maize and of sorghum imported into Spain and Portugal are booked by the Commission on an annual basis taking account of all imports actually carried out  including imports of certain cereal substitute products which are deducted in proportion to the total quantities to be imported into Spain. (3) In the case of maize imports  the import period for Portugal corresponds at present to the marketing year while it corresponds to the calendar year in the case of Spain. To ensure the sound management of the abatimento quotas  identical import and accounting periods should be fixed for those two countries  i.e. the calendar year. However  in order to avoid any overlap between the new and old accounting periods  a specific quota should be opened for Portugal for the second half of 2007. This Regulation must therefore apply from 1 July 2007. (4) To ensure that the Community’s international commitments are met  an additional period should also be provided for  running beyond the calendar year  so enabling these commitments for each reference calendar year to be met. The length of this additional period must be the same for Spain and Portugal. (5) Changes were made to the customs nomenclature in 2002 as regards certain substitute products to be booked against the abatimento quotas in Spain. CN codes 2308 90 30 (citrus pulp residues) and 2308 10 00 were merged. The products concerned now fall within CN code 2308 00 40. The list of products to be booked within the framework of abatimento quotas should therefore be adapted accordingly. (6) Moreover  since the introduction of these quota arrangements  certain specific trade concessions for maize have been granted by the Community within the framework of both preferential and non-preferential arrangements. These new concessions apply independently of the abatimento quotas. They presently comprise the concessions granted by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process  amending Regualtion (EC) No 2820/98 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 2/2000 (3)  by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States  of the one part  and the Republic of Croatia  of the other part (4)  approved by Council and Commission Decision 2005/40/EC  Euratom (5)  by the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community  of the one part  and the Republic of Albania  of the other part (6)  approved by Council Decision 2006/580/EC (7)  and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 969/2006 of 29 June 2006 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for imports of maize from third countries (8). (7) Accordingly  in order to ensure the sound management of the arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1839/95  while continuing to observe the Community’s international obligations  the imports to be booked as abatimento quotas should be clearly specified. (8) The current provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 provide for the extension of the period for booking imports into Spain to the end of February each year  but do not lay down any rules for Portugal. This situation is unsatisfactory as it creates uncertainty in the application of the arrangements. In order to remove this uncertainty and to ensure the sound management of the abatimento quotas  provision should be made for similar methods for booking imports of maize and sorghum effected in Spain and in Portugal. (9) In order to attain this objective and to guarantee effective monitoring by the Commission of the arrangements and of the Community’s international obligations  provision should be made for Spain and Portugal to communicate to the Commission  each month  all imports of the products concerned actually carried out  specifying the calculation method applied. (10) Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 should therefore be amended accordingly.

In particular  it provides that products of animal origin are only to be imported from a third country or part of a third country that appears on a list drawn up in accordance with that Regulation. (2) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 also provides that when drawing up and updating such lists  account is to be taken of Union controls in third countries and guarantees provided by the competent authorities of third countries  as regards compliance or equivalence with Union feed and food law and animal health rules as specified in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law  animal health and animal welfare rules (2). (3) Commission Decision 2006/766/EC of 6 November 2006 establishing the lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs  echinoderms  tunicates  marine gastropods and fishery products are permitted (3) lists those third countries which satisfy the criteria referred to in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 and are therefore able to guarantee that exports of those products to the Union meet the sanitary conditions laid down in Union legislation to protect the health of consumers. In particular  Annex II to that Decision sets out a list of third countries and territories from which imports of fishery products for human consumption are permitted. That list also indicates restrictions concerning such imports from certain third countries. (4) Serbia is currently included in the list in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC as a third country from which imports of fishery products intended for human consumption are permitted  but such imports are restricted to whole fresh fish from wild seawater catches. (5) Union controls to evaluate the control system in place in Serbia governing the production of fishery products intended for export to the Union  together with guarantees provided by the competent authority of Serbia  indicate that the conditions applicable in that third country to fishery products for human consumption destined for export to the Union are equivalent to those laid down in the relevant Union legislation. Accordingly  Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC should be amended in order to permit imports from Serbia of fishery products for human consumption  but not subject to the current restriction. (6) Decision 2006/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Each year the Commission is required to determine essential uses for these controlled substances  the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them. (3) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer  hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’  sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party. (4) Decision XV/8 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A  B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties  subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties  as well as Decisions VII/11  XI/15 and XV/5 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Decision XVII/10 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption of the controlled substance listed in Annex E of the Montreal Protocol necessary to satisfy laboratory and analytical uses of methyl bromide. (5) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs)  all Member States have notified (2) to the United Nations Environment Programme the active ingredients for which chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of CFC-MDIs for placing on the market of the European Community. (6) Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have therefore reduced the demand for CFCs used in MDIs that are placed on the market of the European Community. In addition  Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1). (7) The Commission has published a Notice (3) on the 22 July 2006 to those companies in the Community of 25 Member States that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2007 and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances for 2007. (8) For the purpose of ensuring that interested companies and operators may continue to benefit in due time from the licensing system  it is appropriate that the present decision shall apply from 1 January 2007.

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However  that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff. (2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market. (3) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector. (4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. They also remain in force in cases where no quotation is available for the reference exchange referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 during the two weeks preceding the next periodical fixing. (5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally  the representative market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties. (6) Application of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 results in import duties being fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROCEDURE (1) On 28 May 1997  the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious dumping by imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips  of iron or non-alloy steel  cold-rolled  originating in Russia. (2) The complaint was lodged by the Italian Narrow Cold-Rolled Strips Producers Association (Federacciai)  on behalf of Italian producers whose collective output was alleged to represent the quasi-totality of Italian production of cold-rolled narrow strips. (3) The complaint contained evidence of dumping by the imports concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (4) The Commission  after consultation  accordingly announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips  of iron or non-alloy steel  cold-rolled  currently classifiable within CN codes 7211 23 99  7211 29 50  7211 29 90 and ex 7211 90 90 and originating in Russia.

Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) By letter of 12 September 1997 to the Commission  Federacciai formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips  of iron or non-alloy steel  cold-rolled  originating in Russia in view of the current market situation concerning this product. (7) Interested parties were informed that  under these circumstances  the Commission intends to terminate the proceeding  and were given the opportunity to comment. None of them raised any objection. (8) The Commission considers therefore that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips  of iron or non-alloy steel  cold-rolled  originating in Russia  should be terminated without the imposition of protective measures  and that such a termination would not be against the interest of the Community.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1555,COMMISSION  DECISION of 23 November 1987 settling a dispute between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg about the authorization of a regular coach service (Only the German and French texts are authentic) (88/40/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 517/72 of 28 February 1972 on the introduction of common rules for regular and special regular services by coach and bus between Member States (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1301/78 (2)  hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'  and in particular Article 14 thereof  I Whereas the company Deutsche Touring GmbH Frankfurt/Main  hereinafter referred to as 'Touring'  has operated a regular coach service between Duesseldorf and Luxembourg since 1965 for passengers arriving at or leaving from Luxembourg airport; whereas  after the Regulation had entered into force  this service was authorized by the relevant authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as a special coach service for passengers holding a Luxavia air ticket; whereas this authorization expired on 8 June 1986. Whereas this service was contracted out to the Luxembourg firm  Voyages Emile Weber S.a.r.l.  Canach after talks between Touring and the FĂŠdĂŠration luxembourgeoise des exploitants d'autobus et d'autocars; Whereas  on 20 February 1986  Touring applied to the Minister for Urban Development  Housing and Transport of North Rhine-Westphalia for the authorization which expired on 8 June 1986 to be renewed; whereas Touring received a provisional authorization until 7 September 1986 pursuant to Article 16a of the Regulation; whereas  however  on 14 August 1986  the local authorizing authority in Duesseldorf  in the person of the Regierungspraesident  rejected the application for a renewal of the authorization; Whereas  on 1 December 1986  the Federal Minister of Transport asked the Luxembourg Minister of Transport to accept this decision by the German authorizing authority; whereas  on 21 January 1987  the Luxembourg Minister of Transport rejected this request in a letter to the relevant Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and asked for the decision by the authorizing authority in Duesseldorf to be reconsidered; whereas  in a letter of 9 March 1987 to the Federal Minister of Transport  the Luxembourg Minister of Transport confirmed its position stressing that it placed great importance on the continuation of this service; Whereas  on 11 March 1987  Emile Weber S.a.r.l. itself applied to the Luxembourg Minister of Transport for an authorization for this service; whereas it received a provisional three-month authorization in March 1987; whereas this was extended before its expiry until 9 September 1987; Whereas the relevant Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia informed the Luxembourg Minister of Transport of its refusal to renew the authorization by letter of 22 May 1987; Whereas  in view of the fact that the two governments were unable to reach agreement on a new authorization for the service  the Luxembourg Government referred the dispute to the Commission on 1 June 1987 pursuant to Article 14 of the Regulation requesting that the application made by Emile Weber S.a.r.l. be approved; Whereas the German Government made a similar application to the Commission on 1 July 1987 requesting the Commission to settle the dispute and  if it gave a positive ruling  to grant the authorization to Touring; whereas Touring is willing to continue to contract the service out to Emile Weber S.a.r.l. as it has done in the past; Whereas Touring confirmed its willingness to do so in a letter of 7 July 1987 to the Federal Minister of Transport; Whereas the Member States concerned attended a meeting at the Commission in Brussels on 3 July 1987 to discuss these two applications; II Whereas the German authorizing authority put forward the following arguments: The authorization would be incompatible with the interests of public transport. Article 8 of the Regulation should be interpreted as a provision favouring the railways which form the backbone of passenger transport in all European countries. The railways needed therefore to be protected against competition from private regular services. The economic interests of such firms in the establishment of further passenger services would have to be subordinated to this need. In this particular case  the State also had to act in the interests of the Community as a whole and the overriding public concern to maintain an efficient transport system. The regular road service for which authorization is requested is  in this case  only a seemingly better service  the cost being included in the price of the air fare. The time required for the rail journey is not excessive for passengers compared with their overall travelling time. Rail transport also guarantees connections even if flights are not on time. The rail connection between Duesseldorf and Luxembourg (10 trains a day in each direction and a journey of three and a half to four hours) can generally be said to provide a quantitatively and qualitatively satisfactory solution to the transport needs in question; Whereas the Luxembourg Government put forward the following arguments: The regular service in question has existed for over 20 years and has given no reason for complaint during that time. The persons using this service are solely Luxavia passengers who have paid for the cost of the connecting journey in the price of their air ticket. The transfer of this service to the railways is unacceptable to passengers: - owing to the problems involved in changing means of transport/vehicle several times with cumbersome luggage  - owing to the fact that the journey takes longer by rail than by road  - because there are no immediate connections if flights arrive late  - because of the need to pick passengers up at Brussels or take passengers to Brussels since flights are often diverted there; III Whereas the applications made by the two Governments are admissible under Article 14  and in accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation; whereas they should be examined in the light of Article 8 (1) and (2)  subparagraph (a) thereof; Whereas the aim of these provisions is  as defined in the recitals to the Regulation  to ensure the proper functioning of services at minimum cost to the community in general  and it is necessary to adapt the supply of transport to demand on the routes to be served and to coordinate passenger transport services in the areas concerned in an effective manner; Whereas the principle of coordinating transport services to satisfy specific transport needs effectively and at minimum cost must  however  be applied in specific cases in the light of the Community's transport policy and the structure of its transport markets; whereas Article 8 of the Regulation cannot hence be interpreted as a provision which provides absolute protection to the railways or which gives unconditional priority to them; whereas  although the railways are an essential means of transport for passengers in the Community economy  they cannot have a monopoly in these markets; Whereas  at this level of generality  the principal reasons given by the authorizing authority in Duesseldorf for its decision cannot therefore be accepted; Whereas decisions in individual cases can  on the contrary  only be made in the light of the particular conditions applying; whereas  although this does not mean that the public transport interests do not have to be taken into account  they do have to be weighed against the specific interests of the transport users concerned and of other transport enterprises; Whereas  after examining the present and foreseeable transport needs which have to be satisfied by the transport service in question  it has been concluded that a direct coach service between Duesseldorf and Luxembourg through the Eifel offers transport users appreciable advantages over a rail service via Trier and Koblenz. Whereas the coach service has in this particular case the qualitative advantages of: - a direct connection between Luxembourg airport and Duesseldorf main station without the need to change or transfer luggage  which would be the case by rail  - a shorter journey. Whereas this cannot be outweighed by the somewhat greater comfort (more space  refreshments) of rail transport; Whereas the coach service also has one great quantitative advantage  namely that it provides a guaranteed and straightforward connection with the flight  even if aeroplanes are diverted to Brussels; Whereas  when all the relevant factors are taken into account in this comparison  it must be concluded that road transport offers a better overall service; whereas this is of particular relevance in this specific case as it involves a special regular service with a limited number of customers and special needs; Whereas  furthermore  this service has operated for over 20 years without any problems; whereas it is hard to see how the market situation and effect on the transport industries can have changed so much that the authorization must now be refused on the basis of new factors or events; whereas a major factor militating in favour of the renewal of the authorization is the interest of both companies in continuing a service they have offered  without objections being made and in accordance with the authorization  over a long period  with all the investment which is tied up in it; whereas  the operators' interest generally corresponds to the still existing and undisputed demand on the side of the transport users; Whereas  in the light of all these factors  it is concluded that the coach service for which authorization is applied offers a better service than the competing rail services which do not satisfy the specific needs of this particular transport market in the same way ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products. (5) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions. (6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream  butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products  ice cream and other foodstuffs (3)  lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods. (7) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

1558,21.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 337/54 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1541/2007 of 20 December 2007 on proof of completion of customs formalities for the import of sugar into third countries as provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1) and in particular Article 40(1)(g)  Whereas: (1) Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that export refunds in the sugar sector may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (2) Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 900/2007 of 27 July 2007 on a standing invitation to tender to determine refunds on exports of white sugar until the end of the 2007/2008 marketing year (2) provides for such differentiation by excluding certain destinations. (3) Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3) provides that where the rate of refund varies according to destination  refunds are to be paid subject to the additional conditions laid down under Articles 15 and 16 of that Regulation. (4) Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that the products must have been imported in their unaltered state into the third country or one of the third countries for which the refund applies. (5) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 lists the various documents that may constitute proof of the completion of customs formalities in a third country where the refund rate is differentiated according to destination. Under paragraph 4 of that Article the Commission may decide  in certain specific cases to be determined  that the proof referred to in that Article may be deemed to be furnished by a specific document or in any other way. (6) In the sugar sector export operations are normally governed by contracts defined as fob on the London futures market. As a result  purchasers accept at that fob stage all the contractual obligations  including proof of completion of customs formalities  without being the direct beneficiaries of the refund to which that proof confers the right. Obtaining that proof for all quantities exported may entail considerable administrative difficulties in certain countries  which may substantially delay or prevent payment of the refund for all the quantities actually exported. (7) In order to limit the impact on the equilibrium of the sugar market  Commission Regulation (EC) No 436/2007 of 20 April 2007 on proof of completion of customs formalities for the import of sugar into third countries as provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (4) provides for relaxation of the rules on proof of completion of customs formalities until 31 December 2007. (8) Given that the administrative difficulties that prompted this derogation and their impact on the market persist  the alternative proofs of destination should apply for 2008.

By Regulation (EC) No 132/2001 (4)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ammonium nitrate originating in Ukraine. By Regulation (EC) No 993/2004 (5) the Council amended Regulations (EC) No 658/2002 and (EC) No 132/2001. (2) The measures are specific duty of 47 07 EUR/tonne in the case of Russia and 33 25 EUR/tonne in the case of Ukraine. 2.   Investigation (3) On 20 March 2004 the Commission announced through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union  (6) the initiation of a partial interim review of the measures in force (‘the measures’) pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 22(c) of the basic Regulation. (4) The review was launched at the initiative of the Commission in order to examine whether  as a consequence of the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 (‘Enlargement’) and  bearing in mind the aspect of Community interest  there is a need to adapt the measures in order to avoid a sudden and excessively negative effect on all interested parties including users  distributors and consumers. (5) All interested parties  including the Community industry  associations of producers or users in the Community  exporters/producers in the countries concerned  importers and their associations and the relevant authorities of the countries concerned as well as interested parties in the 10 new Member States which acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004 (the ‘EU10’) were advised of the initiation of the investigation and were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing  to submit information and to provide supporting evidence within the time-limit set out in the notice of initiation. All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing. 3.   Result of the investigation (6) As set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 993/2004  the investigation concluded that it is in the Community interest to adapt the existing measures  provided that such adaptation does not significantly undermine the desired level of trade defence. 4.   Undertakings (7) In accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) No 993/2004  the Commission  in conformity with Article 8 (2) of the basic Regulation  suggested undertakings to the companies concerned. As a result  undertakings were subsequently proposed by  (i) one exporting producer of the product concerned in Ukraine (OJSC ‘Azot’)  (ii) an exporting producer in Russia (CJSC MCC Eurochem in respect of goods produced at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot  Russia) jointly with its related company (Cumberland Sound Ltd  British Virgin Islands)  (iii) two related exporting producers in Russia (OAO Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat and JSC ‘Azot’)  separately and (iv) two related exporting producers jointly (Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’  Russia and Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’  Russia). (8) From the submissions of OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’ and publicly available information on the Internet  it is known to the Commission that JSC ‘Azot’ and OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’ are linked via Agrochemical Corporation ‘Azot’  which owns considerably more than 5 % of the capital of each of the companies. Therefore  in accordance with an Article 2 of the basic Regulation and the definition of related parties set out in the Article 143 of Commission Regulation (EEC) 2454/93 (7)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2286/2003 (8)  the Commission considers JSC ‘Azot’ and OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’ as related parties. It should be noted that the abnormal increases of the export volumes of one of these two exporting producers  OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’  to the EU10 observed during the first months of 2004 were higher than the combined traditional export volumes to the EU10 of both JSC ‘Azot’ and OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’. Accordingly  the undertaking offers submitted by these two exporting producers are rejected because the undertaking ceiling for the two exporting producers taken together  calculated as traditional export volumes to the EU10 in 2001 and 2002 minus the abnormal increases in export volumes to the EU10 observed in the first months of 2004  is negative. (9) It should be noted that  in application of Article 22(c) of the basic Regulation  any undertakings accepted by this Regulation are considered as special measures since  in accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) No 993/2004  they are not directly equivalent to an anti-dumping duty. (10) Nevertheless  in conformity with Regulation (EC) No 993/2004  the undertakings oblige each individual producing exporter to respect minimum import prices within the framework of import ceilings and  in order that the undertakings can be monitored  the exporting producers concerned have also agreed to broadly respect their traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU10. The exporting producers are also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly  or that the undertakings become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor  the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place  or it may adjust the level of the ceiling  or it may take other remedial action. (11) It is also a condition of the undertakings that if they are breached in any way  the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in their place. (12) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community  meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission. (13) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertakings  when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to an undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 993/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable. (14) In view of all the above  the offers of undertakings submitted by OJSC ‘Azot’  CJSC MCC Eurochem in respect of goods produced at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot  Russia  and Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’ together with Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’ are considered acceptable. (15) The acceptance of the undertakings is limited to an initial period of six months without prejudice to the normal duration of the measures. However  six months after acceptance of the undertakings  their continued acceptance will be subject to an appraisal by the Commission to verify whether the exceptional and negative conditions for end users in the EU10 which led to the acceptance of the undertakings still exist. In view of the short term character of the undertakings and the exceptional circumstances under which they are accepted the Commission services may  after consultation of the Advisory Committee  adapt some of the terms of the undertakings  if after a reasonable period of time it is established that the undertakings are not achieving their intended results in terms of allowing traditional export flows to the EU10 to continue. However  the adapted terms of the undertakings must continue to ensure a significant contribution to the removal of injury. B.   REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (16) In view of the unusual circumstances of this case and the inherent risk of breaches of undertakings caused by the price differences between the EU10 and the EU15 and their short term character  it is considered that sufficient grounds exist to make certain imports of the product concerned subject to registration for a maximum period of nine months in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. (17) Customs authorities are therefore directed to take the appropriate steps to register imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Ukraine and Russia exported by the companies which have offered acceptable undertakings and for which benefit from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties is sought. (18) In the event of a finding of a breach of the undertakings  duties may be levied retroactively on goods entered into free circulation in the Community from the date of the breach of the undertaking ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2).

(2) The Commission  by Decision 2001/602/EC (3)  accepted price undertakings offered by Open Joint Stock Company Cherepovetsky Staleprokatny Zavod  Russia (‘ChSPZ’) and Usha Siam Steel Ind.  Public Company Ltd  Thailand (‘Usha Siam’). (3) On 10 August 2004  the Commission initiated a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation  limited in scope to the examination of dumping as far as ChSPZ and another Russian producer are concerned (4). (4) As explained in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union  (5)  ChSPZ's name was changed to Closed Joint Stock Company Severstal-Metiz  applicable as of 1 January 2006. (5) On 3 August 2006  the Commission initiated an expiry review of Council Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 (6). (6) On 22 March 2007 (7)  the Commission initiated a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 limited in scope to the examination of dumping as far as Usha Siam is concerned. (7) All three investigations have been concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 1279/2007 (8) which imposed with certain amendments to the level of the duties the measures for Russia and repealed the measures for Thailand and Turkey. B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING OF CLOSED JOINT STOCK COMPANY SEVERTAL-METIZ  RUSSIA (8) As set out in recital 199-203 of Regulation (EC) No 1279/2007 and after having consulted all parties concerned  the undertaking of Closed Joint Stock Company Severstal-Metiz in its current form is not appropriate to counteract the injurious effect of dumping  since it presents considerable monitoring and enforcement difficulties. (9) The interim review revealed that since the acceptance of the undertaking in 2001 the product range of SSM had changed significantly. (10) The undertaking classified the SWR produced by them in a considerable number of product types with significant price variations within each type. The review investigation confirmed that the company had serious problems in classifying the different product types properly and in accordance with the terms of the undertaking. This was partly due to accounting system limitations which did not allow them to properly distinguish between different SWR product types. Similar problems were already identified during the monitoring of the undertaking and led to a warning letter. (11) It has therefore been concluded that the undertaking in its current form is no longer workable. (12) On this basis and in accordance with the relevant clauses of the undertaking  which authorise the Commission to unilaterally withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking  the Commission has decided to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking. (13) The Commission informed the Russian authorities and the Russian exporting producer concerned that it proposed to withdraw the acceptance of the current undertaking. The interested parties were given the opportunity to comment. C.   REPEAL OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING OF USHA SIAM STEEL IND. PUBLIC COMPANY LTD.  THAILAND (14) In the light of the findings regarding Thailand and as set out in recital 209 of Regulation (EC) No 1279/2007 anti-dumping measures against imports of the product concerned originating in this country are repealed. (15) As a consequence  the undertaking offered by Usha Siam should be repealed. D.   REPEAL OF DECISION 2001/602/EC (16) In the light of the above  Decision 2001/602/EC accepting undertakings from the two companies mentioned above should be repealed ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Germany informed the Commission of the intention of its intervention agency to increase by 499923 tonnes the quantity for which a standing invitation to tender for export has been opened. The total quantity of barley held by the German intervention agency for which a standing invitation to tender for export has been opened should be increased to 3499978 tonnes. (3) This increase in the quantity put out to tender makes it necessary to alter the list of regions and quantities in store. Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 668/2001 must therefore be amended.

(2) In respect of international shipping a comprehensive framework enhancing maritime safety and the protection of the environment with regard to pollution from ships has been set up through the adoption of a number of conventions for which the International Maritime Organisation (hereinafter the IMO) is the depository. (3) Under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  1982 (UNCLOS) and of the conventions for which IMO is the depository (hereinafter the IMO Conventions)  the States which are party to those instruments are responsible for promulgating laws and regulations and for taking all other steps which may be necessary to give those instruments full and complete effect so as to ensure that  from the point of view of safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment  a ship is fit for the service for which it is intended and is manned with competent maritime personnel. (4) Due account has to be taken of the Maritime Labour Convention  adopted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 2006  which also addresses flag State-related obligations. (5) On 9 October 2008  the Member States adopted a statement in which they unanimously recognised the importance of the application of the international conventions related to flag States obligations in order to improve maritime safety and to contribute to preventing pollution by ships. (6) Implementation of the procedures recommended by the IMO in MSC/Circ.1140/MEPC/Circ.424 of 20 December 2004 on the transfer of ships between States should strengthen the provisions of the IMO Conventions and Community maritime safety legislation relating to a change of flag and should increase transparency in the relationship between flag States  in the interests of maritime safety. (7) The availability of information on ships flying the flag of a Member State  as well as on ships which have left a register of a Member State  should improve the transparency of the performance of a high-quality fleet and contribute to better monitoring of flag State obligations and to ensuring a level playing field between administrations. (8) In order to help Member States in further improving their performance as flag States  they should have their administration audited on a regular basis. (9) A quality certification of administrative procedures in accordance with the standards of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) or equivalent standards should further ensure a level playing field between administrations. (10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4). (11) Since the objectives of this Directive  namely the introduction and implementation of appropriate measures in the field of maritime transport policy  cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore  by reason of its scale and effects  be better achieved at Community level  the Community may adopt measures  in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality  as set out in that Article  this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

1616,COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 907/97 of 20 May 1997 amending Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of synthetic fibres of polyesters originating in India and the Republic of Korea THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  and in particular Article 11 (4) thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 (2)  the Council imposed  inter alia  a definitive anti-dumping duty of 7 2 % on imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyesters  not carded  combed or otherwise processed for spinning  commonly referred to as synthetic fibres of polyester (hereinafter referred to as the 'product concerned` of 'PSF`)  currently classifiable within CN code 5503 20 00 and originating in India  with the exception of imports from five Indian exporters specifically mentioned  which were subject either to a lesser rate of duty or to no duty at all. B. PRESENT PROCEDURE (2) In January 1996  the Commission received  from the Indian producer Viral Filaments Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'Viral` or the 'company`)  an application for a review of the measures currently in force  i.e. a request to initiate a 'new exporter` review proceeding of Regulation (EEC) No 54/93  pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`). Viral claimed that it was not related to any of the exporters or producers in India subject to the anti-dumping measures in force with regard to the product concerned. Furthermore  it claimed that it did not export the product concerned during the period of investigation on which the current measures in force were based with regard to the determination of dumping  i.e. the period from 1 January to 31 August 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the 'original investigation period`). Finally  Viral also claimed that it had actually exported the product concerned to the Community and that it had also entered into irrevocable contractual obligations to export significant quantities of PSF to the Community. (3) The Commission  after having verified the evidence submitted by the Indian exporter concerned  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with Article 11 (4) of the Basic Regulation  after consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  initiated  by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1285/96 (3)  a review of Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 with regard to Viral and commenced its investigation. In the Regulation initiating the review  the Commission also repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 with regard to imports of the product concerned  produced and exported to the Community by Viral  and directed customs authorities  pursuant to Article 14 (5) of the Basic Regulation  to take appropriate steps to register such imports. (4) The product covered by the present review is the same product as the one under consideration in Regulation (EEC) No 54/93. (5) The Commission officially advised Viral and the representatives of the exporting country. Furthermore  it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However  no such request has been received by the Commission. The Commission sent a questionnaire to Viral and received a proper and timely reply. The Commission sought and verify all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation. (6) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996. (7) The same methodology as that used in the original investigation was applied in the present investigation where circumstances had not changed. C. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW (8) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made in this investigation  this review is limited to dumping. D. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION 1. New exporter qualification (9) The investigation confirmed that Viral had not exported the product concerned during the original investigation period. Production of PSF by Viral and export thereof to the Community started  in fact  only during the second half of 1995. Furthermore  according to documentary evidence submitted  Viral satisfactorily demonstrated that it did not have any links  either direct or indirect  with any of Indian exporters subject to the anti-dumping measures in force with regard to the product concerned. Accordingly  it is confirmed that Viral should be considered as a new exporter in accordance with Article 11 (4) of the Basic Regulation  and thus its individual dumping margin should be determined. 2. Dumping A. Normal value (10) In accordance with Article 2 (2) of the Basic Regulation  an examination was conducted to ascertain whether the volume of Viral's sales of PSF on the Indian domestic market in total reached at least 5 % of the volume of the Indian exports of the product concerned to the Community. It was established  based on the documentary evidence submitted in the company's questionnaire reply  that domestic sales of the like product achieved a level considerably in excess of the aforementioned 5 % threshold. For each of the types of PSF sold on the domestic market and found to be identical or directly comparable to types sold for export to the Community  the Commission then established whether domestic sales per type were made in sufficient quantities. Domestic sales of each type were considered to have been made in sufficient quantities within the meaning of Article 2 (2) of the Basic Regulation as the volume of each type of PSF sold in India during the investigation period represented 5 % or more of the quantity of the comparable type of PSF sold for export to the Community. The Commission subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of each type of PSF exported to the Community could be considered to have been made in the ordinary course of trade. Whether or not domestic sales were made in the ordinary course of trade was determined pursuant to Article 2 (4) of the Basic Regulation. Since  per product type  the weighted average selling price was equal to  or higher than  the weighted average unit cost and as the volume of sales below unit cost represented less than 20 % of the sales being used to determine normal value  all domestic sales were regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade. In accordance with Article 2 (1) of the Basic Regulation  normal value was therefore based on the weighted average prices of all domestic sales of the corresponding product types exported to the Community. B. Export price (11) Export prices were established on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product concerned when sold for export to the Community  in accordance with Article 2 (8) of the Basic Regulation. C. Comparison (12) In accordance with Article 2 (11) of the Basic Regulation  the weighted average normal value by product type was compared  on an ex-factory basis  to the weighted average export price at the same level of trade. For the purpose of a fair comparison  due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences which were claimed and demonstrated to affect price comparability. These adjustments were made  in accordance with Article 2 (10) of the Basic Regulation  in respect of commissions  transport  insurance  handling and ancillary costs  credit costs  discounts and rebates. D. Dumping margin (13) The above comparison revealed that no dumping existed for exports to the Community of the product concerned made by Viral during the investigation period. E. AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED (14) Based on the findings of no dumping made during the investigation  it is considered that no anti-dumping measure should be imposed on imports into the Community of PSF  produced and exported by Viral. Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 should therefore be amended accordingly. F. DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURE (15) Viral was informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to propose the amendment to Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 and was given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received. (16) This review carried out does not affect the date on which Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 will expire pursuant to Article 11 (2) of the Basic Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1627,Commission Regulation (EC) No 893/2004 of 29 April 2004 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1)  and in particular Article 31(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.

That Decision introduced in Commission Decision 2006/133/EC (3)  as from 16 June 2009  the obligation that susceptible wood packaging material not originating from the demarcated areas undergoes one of the approved treatments specified in Annex I to FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 and is marked according to Annex II to the said Standard before being moved from the demarcated areas to other areas in Member States or in third countries as well as from part of the demarcated area in which the pine wood nematode is known to occur to the part of the demarcated area designated as a buffer zone. (2) Wood packaging material is required for the transport of many goods of all kinds. However  until now the production and use of susceptible wood packaging material treated and marked in accordance with the Annexes I and II to FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 is not generalised in the Community. It appears in particular that not enough wood packaging material complying with the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 can be made available at short time to cover the needs of the economic operators trading goods from Portugal to other Member States or third countries. (3) To avoid risks of disproportionate disruption of trade  it appears necessary to provide for a derogation as regards the date of application of the requirements set out in Decision 2006/133/EC  as amended by Decision 2009/420/EC  which refer to the obligation to treat and mark in accordance with Annexes I and II to FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 susceptible wood packaging material not originating from demarcated areas before moving it from the demarcated areas in Portugal to other areas.

(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4). (3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community. (4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.

The duties in force range from 6 5 % to 23 5 % for four companies with individual duties and the residual duty is 66 7 %. 2.   Request for review (2) On 3 April 2006 the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation to examine the scope of existing measures with a view to including new product types in the product definition. (3) The request was lodged by the European Federation of the Plywood Industry (FEIC) (the applicant) on behalf of Community producers of okoumé plywood. (4) The applicant alleged that new product types have appeared on the market such as plywood consisting solely of sheets of wood  each ply not exceeding 6 mm thickness  with at least one outer ply of bintangor  red canarium  kedondong or certain other species  not coated by a permanent film of other material. These products should be included in the scope of the measures on the grounds that they share the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and end uses as the product covered by the existing measures. Both the product concerned and the new product types should therefore be considered as a single product. 3.   Initiation (5) Having determined  after consulting the Advisory Committee  that sufficient evidence existed to justify the initiation of a partial interim review  the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union  (3) the initiation of a partial interim review in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation  limited in scope to the definition of the product concerned. B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) By a letter dated 5 December 2007 to the Commission  the applicant withdrew its request for the partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of okoumé plywood originating the in the People's Republic of China. (7) According to Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation  a proceeding may be terminated where the request for a review is withdrawn  unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. (8) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. However  no comments were received from any party. Consequently  there is no indication that the termination of the proceeding would not be in the Community interest. (9) The Commission therefore concludes that the review concerning imports of okoumé plywood originating in the People's Republic of China should be terminated without amending the anti-dumping measures in force ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Under Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 refunds can be granted on products exported by the Community  to the extent necessary to enable economically significant quantities to be exported and within the limits ensuing from agreements concluded in line with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) In line with Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 care should be taken to ensure that trade flows already engendered by the granting of refunds are not disturbed. For that reason and given the seasonal nature of fruit and vegetable exports quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3). In setting quantities account must be taken of perishability. (4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 stipulates that when refunds are set account is to be taken of the existing situation and outlook for prices and availability of fruit and vegetables on the Community market and for international trade prices  of marketing and transport costs and of the economic aspects of the exportation envisaged. (5) Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 requires Community market prices to be determined using the prices that are most favourable from the point of view of exportation. (6) The international trade situation or specific requirements of certain markets may necessitate differentiation of the refund on a given product by destination. (7) Economically significant exports can at present be made of shelled almonds  hazelnuts and walnuts in shell. (8) Since nuts have a relatively long storage life export refunds can be set at longer intervals. (9) In order to permit the best possible use of available resources the export refunds should  given the structure of exportation from the Community  be set using system A1.

1676,31.1.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 26/1 COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 161/2006 of 23 January 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain aluminium foil originating  inter alia  in Russia THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation)  and in particular Article 11(3) thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   PROCEDURE 1.   Measures in force (1) Following an investigation (the original investigation)  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 (2)  imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 14 9 % on imports of certain aluminium foil (AHF) originating in Russia. Following the acceptance of an undertaking from the Russian exporting producer ‘United Company Siberian Aluminium’  joint stock company  which has since changed its name (3) to Open Joint Stock Company Rusal Sayanal (Sayanal)  imports from this exporter were exempted from the anti-dumping duty by Commission Decision 2001/381/EC (4). 2.   Request for an interim review (2) A request for a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 was received from Sayanal  an exporting producer of AHF subject to a price undertaking and part of the Russian Aluminium group of companies (Rusal). (3) In its request pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation  Sayanal claimed that the circumstances with regard to dumping  on the basis of which the measures in force were established  had changed and that these changes were of a lasting nature. Sayanal further alleged and provided prima facie evidence to show that a comparison of normal value based on its own costs or domestic prices and export prices to the Community would lead to a reduction of dumping significantly below the level of the current measures (14 9 %). Therefore it claimed that the continued imposition of measures at the existing levels  which were based on the level of dumping previously established  was no longer necessary to offset dumping. 3.   Initiation (4) Having determined  after consulting the Advisory Committee  that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of a partial interim review  the Commission  by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union  (5)  initiated a partial interim review limited in scope to the examination of dumping in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation and commenced its investigation. (5) The Commission officially advised the applicant  as well as the representatives of the exporting country  of the initiation of the interim review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. (6) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to the applicant and received a reply within the deadline. The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of dumping and carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies: — Sayanal  Sayanogorsk  Russia  and its related companies within the Rusal group: — SAZ  Sayanogorsk  Russia (aluminium smelter)  — Rusal Sayanskaya Folga  Dmitrov  Russia (processor of small rolls)  — Trading House Russian Foil  Moscow  Russia  — Trading House Safoil  Moscow  Russia  — Rual Trade (BVI) Limited  Moscow  Russia  — Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH  Düsseldorf  Germany. 4.   Review investigation period (7) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 (the investigation period or IP). B.   PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT 1.   Product concerned (8) The product concerned by the current review is the same as that defined in the original investigation  i.e. certain aluminium foil of a thickness of not less than 0 009 mm and not more than 0 018 mm  not backed  not further worked than rolled  in reels of a width not exceeding 650 mm originating in Russia  currently classifiable under CN code 7607 11 10. 2.   Like product (9) Unlike in the previous investigation  Sayanal and its related companies sold AHF also on the Russian domestic market. Whereas the product concerned sold to the EC is in the form of ‘jumbo reels’  sales on the Russian domestic market were in the form of ‘small rolls’. Small rolls are processed from jumbo reels  by cutting them to smaller lengths and packaging them for sale to end-users. However  it was found that AHF in jumbo reels and small rolls both shared the same physical and chemical characteristics and uses. (10) Consequently  both AHF produced and sold on the Russian domestic market and that exported to the Community have the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and uses and are therefore considered to be alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. C.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION 1.   Normal value (11) Sales on the domestic market are made by Sayanal via Trading House Russian Foil (THRF) to Rusal Sayanskaya Folga (RSF)  which processes the jumbo reels into small rolls and then sells them to independent customers within Russia. (12) There are no sales of jumbo reels to independent customers in Russia  and no representative sales of small rolls to independent customers in the Community. As such  no proper comparison on a model-to-model basis could be made. Therefore normal value was constructed according to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the company’s cost of production plus a reasonable amount for selling  general and administrative costs (SG&A) and for profits. (13) Article 2(5) of the basic Regulation provides for the cost of manufacturing to be adjusted where ‘costs associated with the production and sale of the product under investigation are not reasonably reflected in the records of the party concerned’. (14) The investigation established that the related smelting company was charged a very low price for its electricity  which is generated at the Sayano-Shushenskoe Hydro-Electricity Plant  compared to prices charged in third countries with comparable hydro-electricity plants. The prices are set by the Regional Energy Commission. These prices were considered abnormally low and not reflecting the normal costs. Therefore they were adjusted on the basis of the 2004 price of electricity for energy-intensive manufacturing in another representative market  i.e. Norway  which was found to be EUR 14/MWh. (15) As regards the SG&A  they were determined on the basis of the company’s own data pursuant to the chapeau of Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. However  an adjustment was necessary in order to reflect the fact that  as pointed out in recital 12  the company does not sell the same type of AHF rolls on the EC and Russian markets and that  in addition  these types are sold at a different level of trade. (16) For the same reason  the profit on domestic sales had to be adjusted as well. In order to make such adjustment  and given the existence of intra-group transfer prices  it was considered appropriate to determine the profit on the basis of the profit margin (32 1 %) found for the audited consolidated accounts of the Rusal Group  expressed as a percentage of total costs. 2.   Export price (17) Sales to the EU are made through a series of sales companies within the Rusal group: THRF  Trading House Safoil (Safoil)  Rual Trade (BVI) Limited (Rual) and Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH (SAG). (18) Where sales were made via a related importer in the Community  the export price was constructed on the basis of the resale prices to independent customers. Adjustments were made for all costs incurred between importation and resale by that importer  including SG&A expenses  and a reasonable profit margin  in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. The latter was based on the profit margin found for an unrelated importer in the previous investigation. (19) For sales made through a related company outside the Community  the export price was established on the basis of the resale price paid by the first independent buyer in the Community. 3.   Comparison (20) The comparison of the export price with the constructed normal value was made on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. In order to ensure a fair comparison  account was taken  in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation  of differences in factors which were demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability. On this basis  allowances for differences in transport costs  handling costs  insurance and duty payments were made  where applicable  and justified. Adjustments were also made where the export sales were made via a related company located in a country other than the country concerned or the Community  pursuant to Article 2(10)(i) of the basic Regulation. 4.   Dumping margin (21) As provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation  the weighted average constructed normal value by type was compared with the weighted average net ex-works export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned. (22) The comparison as described above did not show the existence of any dumping. D.   LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES (23) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation it was also examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably be said to be of a lasting nature. (24) In this respect  it was considered first of all that Sayanal has complied with its price undertaking through its subsidiary sales company in the Community  Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH (SAG)  since the imposition of measures. At the same time  Sayanal has retained a substantial share of the Community market  indicating that it is able to compete at non-dumped price levels. (25) The prices of the product concerned sold on third-country markets were also examined in order to assess the behaviour of the company in markets where no trade defence measures are in force. It was found that these prices were only slightly below the current export prices to the Community  and no indications of dumping on these markets were found. It is therefore considered that there is no reason to believe that this change of circumstances and the findings on the absence of dumping would not be of a lasting nature. E.   ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES (26) As a result of the investigation it is considered appropriate to amend the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of AHF from Sayanal. (27) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to recommend an amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 and were given an opportunity to comment. Their comments were considered and taken into account where appropriate ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1948/2002(5)  allows the Commission to fix  in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and on the basis of the tenders submitted  a maximum export refund. In fixing this maximum  the criteria provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 must be taken into account. A contract is awarded to any tenderer whose tender is equal to or less than the maximum export refund. (3) The application of the abovementioned criteria to the current market situation for the rice in question results in the maximum export refund being fixed at the amount specified in Article 1.

(2) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2001 lays down the conditions under which the Commission may take specific measures to prevent an overrun of the quantity laid down or the budget available under the said Agreement. (3) On the basis of information on export licence applications available to the Commission on 19 September 2001  the quantity still available for the period until 15 November 2001  for zone (3) eastern Europe  referred to in Article 9(5) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2001  could be exceeded unless the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund is restricted.

1680,2.3.2010 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 51/2 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 169/2010 of 1 March 2010 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1)  and in particular Article 247 thereof  Whereas: (1) Articles 4k to 4t of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (2)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 312/2009 (3)  provide that economic operators not established in the customs territory of the Community are to be registered by the customs authority or the designated authority of the Member State involved. However  it is necessary to specify that economic operators not established in the customs territory of the Community who lodge a customs declaration in the Community to place goods under the temporary importation procedure will not have to be registered for an economic operators registration and identification number (EORI number) if they discharge that procedure by re-exportation. (2) Economic operators established in a contracting party to the Convention on a common transit procedure  approved by Council Decision 87/415/EEC (4)  other than the European Union lodging a customs declaration to place goods under the common transit procedure and economic operators established in Andorra and San Marino lodging a customs declaration to place goods under the Community transit procedure are already assigned traders’ identification numbers that can be used to identify them. They should therefore be excluded from the obligation to be registered for an EORI number. However  that exception should be limited solely to cases where the data provided in the customs declaration is not used as an entry or exit summary declaration  as an EORI number is important for performing risk analyses in such cases. (3) In view of Article 186 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 312/2009  Annex 30a to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be adapted. (4) In order to allow the customs office of the first port or airport of entry to forward  where relevant  information necessary to carry out an appropriate risk analysis to the customs office at any subsequent port or airport as provided for in Article 184e of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93  it is necessary to add a new data requirement and the related data explanatory note to Annex 30a to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. (5) Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should reflect the fact that in some specific cases duties are imposed under customs union agreements concluded by the European Union. (6) Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (5) has been repealed. Currently  Commission Regulation (EC) No 1741/2006 (6) lays down the conditions for granting the special export refund on boned meat of adult male bovine animals placed under the customs warehousing procedure prior to export while Commission Regulation (EC) No 1731/2006 (7) lays down special detailed rules for the application of export refunds in the case of certain preserved beef and veal products which require customs supervision and customs control during manufacturing prior to export. Annexes 37 and 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be updated accordingly. (7) Article 152(1)(a)a of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 215/2006 (8) provides for a system whereby unit prices notified by Member States and disseminated by the Commission may be used to determine the customs value of certain perishable goods imported on consignment. That system replaces specific rules for the determination of the customs value of certain perishable goods laid down in Articles 173 to 177 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. Annex 38 to that Regulation should therefore be updated. (8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables (9) has been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 of 21 December 2007 laying down implementing rules of Council Regulations (EC) No 2200/96  (EC) No 2201/96 and (EC) No 1182/2007 in the fruit and vegetable sector (10). That replacement should be reflected in Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. (9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (11) has been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 612/2009 of 7 July 2009 on laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (12). Box 37 of Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be adjusted accordingly. (10) In view of the provisions on simplified procedures set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1875/2006 (13)  it is necessary to update the codes for ‘Additional information’ in Box 44 of Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93  accordingly. (11) Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) contains an obligation to lodge entry summary declarations and Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1875/2006  provides for summary declarations for the purposes of temporary storage. Those two declarations should therefore be included in the ‘List of abbreviations for documents’ in Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. (12) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly. (13) In order to ensure a smooth implementation of this Regulation  it is necessary to provide Member States with time for the necessary adaptation of their computerised systems.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 67/2004 of 15 January 2004 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 as regards the term of validity of export licences in the milk and milk products sector(3) has limited the validity period of export licences up to 30 April 2004. As the measures required for the management of export refunds in the new situation of the market in milk products that will be created by the accession of the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia to the Community on 1 May 2004 are not yet fully in place  it is necessary to provide for continuity of applications for export licences after 31 March 2004 and to maintain the limit on their validity period. However  in order not to compromise the successful functioning of the new tender system provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 580/2004 of 26 March 2004 establishing a tender procedure concerning export refunds for certain milk products(4)  this limitation should not apply to export licences issued in this context. (3) The potential impact of the accession of the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia on 1 May 2004  subject to the entry into force of the Act of Accession of 2003 on the Community milk market and the need to monitor developments in the Community and world markets should be taken into account. It is therefore appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 and to provide that the term of validity of export licences for milk products for which an application has been lodged from 15 April 2004 on should be limited to 30 June 2004.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

Starting from 2003 a ‘mid-term eradication plan’ was implemented by Portugal to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating it. (3) However  Article 23(6) of Directive 2000/29/EC provides for the possibility to implement further action  if this is necessary to combat PWN. (4) In April 2006  Portugal presented to the Standing Committee on Plant Health (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) an overview of the results of the survey and the control campaign conducted between 1 November 2005 and 1 April 2006 in the demarcated area for PWN in Portugal. The results showed that  despite the measures taken in the previous years  the area where PWN is present has enlarged considerably. (5) The Commission and the Committee concluded that the mid-term eradication plan has to be revised by Portugal and that urgent action was required  including an intensified survey campaign and a redefinition of the demarcated area. (6) In May 2006  Portugal presented to the Committee an action plan with measures to be envisaged for combating a further spread of PWN. (6) These measures included an updated delimitation of the demarcated area  eradication of all declining trees in that area  continued monitoring and the creation of a barrier free from all host trees of the pinewood nematode vector  that is a ‘clear cut belt’  which should stop the spread of PWN to other Member States  safeguarding them from devastating losses for pine forests and possible trade restrictions from third countries. It defines in particular the parts of the territory where the clear cut belt will be situated. A final version of this action plan was approved by the Committee in July 2006. (7) In July 2006  Portugal introduced a programme for further actions for PWN and a budget estimation referring to this programme in order to receive a financial contribution from the Community. The different parts of the Portuguese territory where the actions have to take place  which determine the geographical area benefiting from a financial contribution from the Community  are defined in the above mentioned action plan. (8) The programme provided for by Portugal has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively and to conclude that the conditions for the granting of a Community financial contribution  as laid down in Article 23(6) of the Directive have been met. That Community financial contribution should be granted for expenditure under that programme that improves the phytosanitary protection of the rest of the Community against a further spread of PWN from the demarcated area. That contribution should  consequently  be granted for all actions directly linked to the creation of a clear cut belt as an area free from PWN vector hosts. (9) The Community financial contribution may  in general  cover no more than 50 % of eligible expenditure. However  where such further action  is essentially designed to protect Community territories other than that of the Member State concerned  that contribution may be larger. Given the great relevance of PWN for coniferous plants and wood  the rapidity with which the disease spreads  the proximity of another Member State to the infested zone and the possible impact on European forestry and international wood trade  that condition is fulfilled with respect to the measures relating to the creation of a clear cut belt  as provided for in the Portuguese action plan. Therefore  it is appropriate to allocate a Community financial contribution of 75 %. (10) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (7)  plant-health measures are to be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For the purpose of financial control of these measures Articles 9  36 and 37 of Regulation 1290/2005 shall apply. (11) The actions linked to the creation of a clear-cut belt as an area free from PWN vector hosts should be in compliance with the applicable Community environmental legislation.

In that case a contract is awarded to any tenderer whose bid is equal to or lower than the maximum refund. (3) The application of the abovementioned criteria to the current market situation for the cereal in question results in the maximum export refund being fixed at the amount specified in Article 1.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in pigmeat  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162 to 164  167  169 and 170 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination  especially where the world market situation  the specific requirements of certain markets  or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary. (4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2).

1696,Commission Regulation (EC) No 922/2002 of 30 May 2002 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2)  and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 2500 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001(5)  should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(3) The the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has provided information that it satisfies equivalent conditions to those laid down in Community legislation and is able to guarantee that the fishery products it will export to the Community meet the health requirements of Directive 91/493/EEC; it is therefore necessary to include this country in Part II of the list. Nevertheless  following the information and the guarantees received from the competent authorities of this country it is necessary to restrain the imports of fishery products to wild fish intended for direct human consumption. Furthermore  the information provided by the Yugoslav authority does not pertain to Kosovo  as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999  which is subject to international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). It is therefore not possible at this stage to cover Kosovo under Part II of the list.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6)  on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinized starch  no export refund is to be granted.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EC) 1599/1999(2)  the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more (hereinafter referred to as ""the product concerned"") falling within CN code ex 7223 00 19 originating in India. The measures took the form of ad valorem duties of between 0 and 35 4 % on individual exporters with a residual duty of 48 8 %. B. CURRENT PROCEDURE 1. Request for review (2) After the definitive measures had been imposed  the Commission received a request for the initiation of an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999  pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 (hereinafter referred to as ""the basic Regulation"")  from two Indian producers of the product concerned  Sindia Steels Limited and Nevatia Steel &  Alloys Private Limited (""Nevatia"")  both located in Mumbai. The companies concerned claimed that they were not related to any other exporting producers of the product concerned in India. Furthermore  they claimed that they had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998)  but had exported the product concerned to the Community since then. 2. Initiation of an accelerated review (3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the two Indian exporting producers concerned and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  the Commission initiated  by a notice in the Official Journal(3)  an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the companies concerned and commenced its investigation. 3. Product concerned (4) The product covered by the current review is the same product as that under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999. 4. Parties concerned (5) The Commission officially advised the two companies concerned and the Government of India (GOI). Furthermore  it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However  no such request was received by the Commission. The Commission sent a questionnaire to the companies concerned and received full replies within the deadline. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation and carried out verification visits at the premises of the companies concerned. 5. Investigation period (6) The investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999 (hereinafter referred to as ""the investigation period""). 6. Methodology (7) The same methodology as that used in the original investigation was applied in the current investigation. C. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW (8) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made in this investigation  this review was limited to subsidisation. (9) The Commission examined the same subsidy schemes which were analysed in the original investigation. It was also examined whether the exporting producers had used any subsidy schemes which were alleged in the original complaint but not used during the original investigation. It was finally examined whether the exporting producers had made use of any subsidy schemes which were established after the end of the original investigation period  or had received ad hoc subsidies after this date. D. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION 1. Withdrawal of request for review (10) During the investigation  one company  Nevatia  withdrew its request for an accelerated review. Therefore  the investigation regarding this company shall be terminated. Consequently  the further analysis only refers to the other request for an accelerated review  i.e. by Sindia Steels Limited. 2. New exporter qualification (11) The investigation confirmed that Sindia Steels Limited had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation and that they had begun exporting to the Community after this period. Furthermore  Sindia Steels Limited was able to demonstrate satisfactorily that it did not have any links  direct or indirect  with any of the Indian exporting producers subject to the countervailing measures in force with regard to the product concerned. Accordingly  it is confirmed that Sindia Steels Limited should be considered as a new exporter in accordance with Article 20 of the basic Regulation  since it was not individually investigated during the original investigation for reasons other than a refusal to cooperate with the Commission  and thus an individual countervailing duty rate should be determined for it. 3. Subsidisation (12) On the basis of the information contained in the replies to the Commission's questionnaire  the following five schemes were investigated: - Passbook Scheme  - Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme  - Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme  - Export Processing Zones/Export Oriented Units  - Income Tax Scheme. 4. Passbook Scheme (PBS) (13) Sindia Steels Limited had not availed itself of the Passbook Scheme which  on 1 April 1997  i.e. during the original investigation period  was abolished and replaced by its successor  the Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPB). 5. Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPB) General (14) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had received benefits under this scheme. This company made use of the DEPB on a post-export basis. Under this scheme  any eligible exporter can apply for credits which are calculated as a percentage of the value of exported finished products. Such DEPB rates have been established by the Indian authorities for most products  including the products concerned  on the basis of the Standard Input/Output Norms (SION). A licence stating the amount of credit granted is issued automatically. DEPB on post-export basis allows for the use of such credits for any subsequent imports (e.g. raw materials or capital goods) except for goods the importation of which is restricted or prohibited. Such imported goods can be sold on the domestic market (subject to sales tax) or used otherwise. DEPB credits are freely transferable. The DEPB licence is valid for a period of 12 months from the date on which the licence is granted. (15) The characteristics of the DEPB have not changed since the original investigation. The scheme is a subsidy contingent upon export performance  and it was therefore determined during the original investigation that it is deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the Basic Regulation. Calculation of the subsidy amount (16) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited did not use the licences to make duty-free imports. Instead this company sold some of its licences  and the benefit was calculated on the basis of the amount of credit in the licence regardless of the sale price of the licence. The company claimed that the benefit should be limited to the effective sale price of the licence  which is often less than the face value of the credits in the licence. However  in accordance with the findings in the initial investigation (Commission Regulation (EC) No 618/1999(4)  recital 34  as confirmed by Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999)  this claim cannot be granted since the sale of a licence at a price less than the face value is a purely commercial decision which does not alter the countervailable benefit from this scheme. As in the original investigation  the total value of the subsidy has been allocated over total exports in the investigation period. Where the company made duly substantiated claims for deductions linked to the payment of fees for obtaining the DEPB Licence  these were granted. Sindia Steels Limited benefited from this scheme during the investigation period and obtained subsidies of 15 5 %. 6. Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCGS) General (17) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had availed itself of this scheme. To benefit from the scheme  a company must provide to the relevant authorities details of the type and value of capital goods which are to be imported. Depending on the level of export commitment which the company is prepared to undertake  the company will be allowed to import capital goods at either a zero rate of duty or a reduced rate. A licence authorising the import at preferential rates is issued automatically. In order to meet the export obligation  goods exported must have been produced using the imported capital goods. An application fee is payable to obtain a licence. (18) The characteristics of the EPCGS have not changed since the original investigation. It was determined during the original investigation that the EPCGS is a countervailable subsidy  as the payment by an exporter of a reduced or zero rate of duty constitutes a financial contribution by the GOI  government revenue otherwise due being foregone  and a benefit is conferred on the recipient by lowering the duties payable or fully exempting him from paying the import duties. The subsidy is contingent in law upon export performance within the meaning of Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation  since it cannot be obtained without a commitment to export goods  and is therefore deemed to be specific and countervailable. Calculation of the subsidy amount (19) Using the same calculation methodology as in the original investigation  the benefit to the exporter has been calculated on the basis of the amount of unpaid customs duty due on imported capital goods by spreading this amount across a period which reflects the normal depreciation of such capital goods in the industry of the product concerned. This period has been established by using the weighted average (on the basis of production volume of the products concerned) of depreciation periods for capital goods actually imported under the EPCGS by Indian producers during the original investigation period  resulting in a normal depreciation period of 15 5 years. This amount has then been allocated over total exports during the investigation period. (20) Sindia Steels Limited obtained a benefit under this scheme of 0 3 %. 7. Export Processing Zones (EPZ)/Export Oriented Units (EOU) (21) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited was not located in an EPZ and was not an EOU. 8. Income Tax Exemption Scheme (ITES) (22) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had not availed itself of the ITES. 9. Other schemes (23) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had neither made use of new subsidy schemes which were established after the end of the original investigation period  nor had it received any ad hoc subsidies after this date. 10. Amount of countervailable subsidies (24) Taking account of the definitive findings relating to the various schemes as set out above  the amount of countervailable subsidies for Sindia Steels Limited is as follows: >TABLE> E. AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED (25) Based on the findings made during the investigation  it is considered that imports into the Community of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more produced and exported by Sindia Steels Limited should be subject to a level of countervailing duty corresponding to individual amounts of subsidies established for this company. (26) Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly. F. DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURE (27) The company concerned has been informed on the facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to propose that Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 be amended  and was given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received. (28) The review carried out does not affect the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 will expire pursuant to Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(3) In order to ensure a more accurate checking of products exported and to minimise the risk of speculation  export licences issued in accordance with Article 20a(12) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should be valid only for the product code for which they are issued. Therefore the exceptions provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) should no longer apply to licences issued as from the next quota year. (4) Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2390/2000(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts.

(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 87/1999(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

1730,COMMISSION  DECISION of 22 April 1988 concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of certain ball bearings originating in Singapore (NMB (Deutschland) GmbH) (Only the German text is authentic) (88/328/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection againsted dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1761/87 (2)  and in particular Article 16 thereof  Whereas: A. Procedure (1) On 19 July 1984  by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 (3)  a definitive anti-dumping duty of 33 89 % was imposed on imports of certain ball bearings manufactured and exported by the Minebea group of companies and originating in Singapore. (2) In 1985 and 1986 NMB (Deutschland) GmbH  Neu Isenburg  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japanese mother company of the Minebea group  applied  on a regular basis  for the refund of anti-dumping duties amounting in total to DM . . . (4) paid on imports of the ball bearings during the two years in question. This amount represents part of the anti-dumping duties paid; a refund of the remainder was not requested. (3) Following submissions by the applicant  additional information on certain costs  prices  commercial conditions and commercial activities of the Minebea group outside Singapore was requested by the Commission on the basis of the Commission notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping duties (5) (hereinafter referred to as Notice). The applicant complied with all requests for additional information to the satisfaction of the Commission. Subsequently  the applicant was informed of the preliminary results of this examination and given an opportunity to comment on it. It did so  and the comments were taken into consideration prior to this Decision. (4) The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. No Member State disagreed with this opinion. B. Argument of the applicant (5) The applicant has based its claims on the allegation that  for certain sales in the Community  export prices were such that either dumping did not exist or that dumping existed at a level lower than the level of the definitive duty of 33 89 %. C. Admissibility (6) The applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation  in particular that concerning time limits. D. Merits of the claim (7) The applications are founded in part; for the rest they are unfounded. According to Article 16 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84  anti-dumping duties paid by an importer shall be reimbursed if the importer shows that the duty collected exceeds the actual dumping margin  consideration being given to any application of weighted averages. Pursuant to Article 16 (1) and Part II of the Notice the applicant proved that the duty collected exceeded the actual dumping margin to varying degrees depending on the shipment and the bearing type partly as a result of normal value having decreased. To this extent the applications were founded and the applicant agrees with the Commission's calculation. The amount to be refunded is DM . . . . (8) The applicant requests  however  the refund of an additional amount. For the determination of this additional amount  the applicant agrees with the Commission that  when calculating the dumping margin for the purpose of establishing whether it was exceeded by the level of duty or not  the export prices have to be constructed in accordance with Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84. Article 2 (8) (b) provides that an export price is constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported product is first resold to an independent buyer and that allowance shall be made for all costs incurred by the related importer between importation and resale  including customs duties  any anti-dumping duties and other taxes  and for a reasonable profit margin. The applicant maintains  however  that in constructing the export price  the anti-dumping duty should not be deducted; this would then result in a lower dumping margin for the refund calculation and consequently in a higher amount to be refunded. The applicant justifies its request by claiming that  as a result of the Commission's position  imports by independent importers are treated differently from imports by related importers. The Commission has evaluated this argument; it does not find it acceptable. It is of the opinion that the wording of Article 2 (8) (b) is clear: all duties  including anti-dumping duties have to be deducted from the resale price. The Commission would  therefore  by granting the applicant's request  infringe the express requirement of Article 2 (8) (b) and of Part II 2 (b) and (c) of the Notice. Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 establishes different rules for the determination of the export price in different situations depending on whether the importer is related to the exporter or not. This cannot be considered discriminatory. The second essential argument by the applicant  who sold on a duty-paid basis  is that a simple increase of its resale price in the Community by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty  would not allow it to qualify for a refund. The Commission stresses that  had the applicant sold on a duty unpaid basis  a single increase would have been sufficient to allow it to qualify for a refund. Even where  as in the applicant's situation  the imported product was resold in the Community on a duty-paid basis  only one increase of the resale price by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty is necessary  provided that the Commission is satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the case under consideration this increase in the price paid by the independent buyer eliminates or reduces the dumping margin and does not represent merely the anti-dumping duty which the importer could pass back to its customer if it obtained a refund. This could be the case  for example  if either the costs incurred between importation and resale by NMB or Minebea's normal value had been reduced since the original investigation period. In addition  other changes in circumstances could require the application of different adjustment or calculation methods which could lead to the same result  i.e. the elimination or reduction of the dumping margin by a single price increase. In the present case there is no evidence that these conditions are met. For these reasons the applicant's request for the refund of an additional amount has to be rejected ,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

1739,COMMISSION DECISION of 20 March 1998 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of tungsten ores and concentrates originating in the People's Republic of China (98/229/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2)  and in particular Articles 9 and 11 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE 1. Measures in force (1) By Regulation (EEC) No 2735/90 (3)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 610/95 (4)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of tungsten ores and concentrates originating in the People's Republic of China falling within CN code 2611 00 00. 2. Request for a review (2) Following the publication in February 1995 of a Notice of the impending expiry (5) of the measures in force  the Commission received in June 1995 a request for a review lodged by EuromĂŠtaux  on behalf of the totality of Community producers of the product concerned. The request contained evidence that the expiry of the anti-dumping measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping review. (3) On 21 September 1995  the Commission announced  by a Notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (6)  the initiation of a review of Regulation (EEC) No 2735/90 and commenced an investigation pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 (7)  which was replaced during the investigation by Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`). 3. Investigation (4) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country and the Community producers of the initiation of the review  and gave the parties concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time-limit set in the Notice referred to in recital 3. (5) The present review exceeded the period of one year within which it should normally have been concluded pursuant to Article 11(5) of the Basic Regulation  since two other reviews concerning tungsten products  namely tungstic oxide and acid on the one hand  and tungsten carbide and fused carbide on the other hand  were carried out in parallel. In view of the links between the products in the production chain  it was decided to submit the results of all these investigations at the same time. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST FOR AN EXPIRY REVIEW AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) In the course of the investigation  the complainant  EuromĂŠtaux  formally withdrew its request for the expiry review in view of a recent considerable decrease in imports of tungsten ores and concentrates originating in the People's Republic of China. (7) In accordance with Article 11(5) in conjunction with Article 9(1) of the Basic Regulation  when the Community industry withdraws its request for an expiry review  the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would support the continuation of the proceeding. (8) Therefore  interested parties were informed of the Commission's intention to terminate the proceeding and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest. (9) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection. (10) In the light of the above  the Commission has concluded that the continuation of protective measures is unnecessary and that the proceeding should be terminated ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Exceptions may be made to this rule in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 42 of the same Regulation  provided conditions are laid down which offer equivalent guarantees. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 351/2004 of 26 February 2004 fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products (2) has introduced refunds differentiated according to destination for all milk products from 27 February 2004. (3) Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3) indicates which documents may serve as proof that customs formalities for importation have been completed in a third country in cases where the refund rate is differentiated according to destination. Under that Article  the Commission may decide  in certain specific cases to be determined  that proof of import as referred to in that Article may be furnished by a specific document or in any other way. (4) Since subjecting the payment of refunds to the requirements of Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 entails a substantial change in the administrative procedures for both the national authorities and exporters  it has administrative implications and represents a significant financial burden. Obtaining the proof referred to in Article 16 of that Regulation can pose considerable administrative difficulties in some countries. Furthermore  the particular conditions of export of dairy products may render obtaining such proofs even more difficult and burdensome. (5) To alleviate some of the administrative and financial constraints imposed on exporters  and in order to allow the authorities and exporters to set up the new arrangements for the products concerned and introduce the procedures needed to ensure that all the formalities to be completed run smoothly  Commission Regulation (EC) No 519/2004 of 19 March 2004 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 as regards exports of milk and milk products (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 450/2005 of 18 March 2005 on proof that customs formalities for importation of milk and milk products in third countries have been completed as provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (5) provide for a transitional period during which the proof that customs formalities for importation have been completed is made easier. That period expired on 31 December 2005. (6) However  in many of the countries of destination appropriate procedures and adequate means to provide for the necessary documents are still not in place. In order to prevent traders from not being granted the export refund for that reason  it is necessary to continue to provide for a transitional regime for the year 2006. The transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 450/2005 have caused some confusion and interpretation questions among the national competent authorities. It is appropriate therefore to re-establish  for the year 2006  the transitional provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 519/2004  which have not caused any interpretation problem. (7) It is appropriate to recall the provisions of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 allowing the competent authorities of the Member States  in case any doubt exists as to the destination of the exported products  to require additional evidence for all refunds proving to their satisfaction that the product has actually been placed on the market in the importing third country.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

1750,"COMMISSION DECISION  of 14 June 1973  relating to proceedings under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/14.111 - Du Pont de Nemours Deutschland)  (Only the German text is authentic)  (73/196/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  and in particular Article 85 thereof; Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 (1) of 6 February 1962  and in particular Article 2 thereof; Having regard to the notification submitted as a precaution only on 31 January 1963 pursuant to Regulation No 17 by ""Adox Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH""  a company established under German law at Frankfurt-on-Main (Germany)  in respect of standard contracts for the sale of photographic products which it applied on the German domestic market; Having regard to the publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities No C 122 of 24 November 1972 of the Summary of the notification pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17; Having regard to the Opinion delivered on 27 March 1973 by the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Monopolies pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation No 17; I Whereas the notification submitted as a precaution only by Adox Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH in 1963 concerned contracts regularly awarded by that company since 1958 in Germany to specialized dealers  both wholesale and retail  wishing to sell one or more categories of the products it then manufactured (photographic films  paper and equipment ; photochemical products ; sensitive products for radiography ; accessories  etc); Whereas under the terms of those standard contracts  concluded for a year with tacit renewal  German dealers undertook to observe strictly Adox's general conditions of sale for the category of products concerned  on pain of their deliveries being stopped  their annual rebates being withheld or financial penalties being imposed ; whereas in particular they expressly agreed to respect the prices and distribution networks specified by the manufacturer and to ensure that these were respected by others ; whereas Adox  for its part  undertook to apply without exception its system of fixed prices  as provided for in the German law; Whereas Adox's general conditions of sale  as they stood in 1963  included in particular:    (a) the requirement that both wholesalers and retailers should strictly apply the resale prices fixed by the manufacturer for each group of purchasers  irrespective of the origin of the products  and that they should not grant any discount whatsoever  whether directly or indirectly; (b) the requirement that wholesalers should only supply retailers in Germany able to provide service to the branch's usual customers and who in turn should undertake to comply with the prices and distribution networks specified by the manufacturer; (c) the requirement that retailers should deliver only to consumers  to the exclusion of any other dealer  and that they should not sell abroad without the manufacturer's permission; Whereas in November 1969 the applicant company - which had meanwhile become Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH - discontinued of its own accord the fixed price system which it had been using on the German market and amended its general conditions of sale  in particular by abolishing the export ban imposed on its German dealers ; whereas in February 1971  following an intervention by the Commission  it also abolished the bans on wholesalers reselling to other wholesalers and on retailers reselling to other retailers;  (1)OJ No 13  21.2.1962  p. 204/62 ; OJ Special edition 1959-62  November 1972  p. 87. Whereas these general conditions of sale  thus amended  are being applied for products supplied by the ""Photographic Department"" of Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH which  in July 1971  took over Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH ; whereas cameras are no longer included in those products as the latter company ceased to manufacture them in 1965; Whereas the Commission has not received any comments from third parties in response to the publication of the summary of the notification; II Whereas  under Article 2 of Regulation No 17  a negative clearance may be granted if the Commission finds  on the basis of facts in its possession  that there are no grounds under Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty for action on its part in respect of the standard contracts and general conditions of sale in question; Whereas those standard distribution contracts  as well as the general conditions of sale  which are of course subject to agreement between the supplier and each of its purchasers  are agreements between undertakings within the meaning of Article 85; Whereas the standard distribution contracts which were concluded between specialized dealers and Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH  Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH or Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH no longer contain any obligation apart from the undertaking entered into by dealers to observe the manufacturer's general conditions of sale; Whereas the present wording of ""General Conditions of Delivery and Payment for Photochemical Products"" and ""General Conditions of Delivery and Payment for Equipment and Spare Parts"" applied by the ""Photographic Department"" of Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH both contain similar clauses relating  inter alia  to the placing of orders  the way of quoting prices  consignments  retention of ownership  conditions of payment  complaints  place of jurisdiction  etc.; Whereas the conditions of sale for photochemical products contain the additional requirement that dealers should provide customers with the usual service of the branch and supply articles only in their original packaging ; whereas the conditions of sale for equipment and spare parts also stipulate that the warranty against manufacturing defects shall in all cases extend over a period of six months; Whereas none of the aforementioned clauses is a direct or indirect restriction against competition among either distributors or consumers within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty ; whereas in particular  dealers  whether wholesale or retail  may deliver their goods to any purchasers  including purchasers outside German territory  at prices which they themselves have freely determined; Whereas  consequently  the facts in the possession of the Commission do not show that the standard contracts and conditions of sale in question have as their object or effect the prevention  restriction or distortion of competition within the Common Market within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty ; whereas  since one of the conditions for applying that paragraph is not satisfied  negative clearance may be granted; III Whereas the standard contracts and conditions of sale as worded prior to February 1971 fell within the provisions of Article 85 (1) because they contained clauses which restricted competition and which might affect trade between Member States  in particular:    (a) a ban on exporting by wholesalers and retailers without the manufacturer's permission; (b) a ban on resales at the same level of distribution  as regards exports within the EEC; (c) a requirement to respect prices fixed by the manufacturer  as regards goods re-imported into Germany from other Member States of the EEC; Whereas such clauses  which were the only ones prohibited under Article 85 (1) and were unlikely to be exempted under the provisions of Article 85 (3)  were finally all eliminated in February 1971; Whereas the agreements in question consequently satisfy the requirements of Article 7 (1) of Regulation No 17 ; whereas  in fact  those agreements  which were in existence when the said Regulation No 17 (13 March 1962) entered into force and which were notified within the time limits fixed in Article 5 (1) of that Regulation  do not satisfy the requirements of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty  but whereas Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH has amended the said agreements so that they no longer fall within the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) ; whereas  as far as the versions of the contracts prior to modifications are concerned  the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) applies only to the period fixed by the Commission; Whereas in this respect account should be taken of the fact that the abovementioned company abolished of its own accord two of the three restricitive clauses mentioned above and abolished the third clause as soon as the Commission so requested ; whereas these circumstances are sufficient to justify the non-application of the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) for the entire period preceding the amendments;",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1751,COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 336/91  of 12 February 1991  on an extension of the term of validity of certain export licences for common wheat THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (2)  and in particular Articles 12 (2) and 16 (6) thereof  Whereas export licences for common wheat were issued on 16 November 1990 with advance fixing of the refund applicable to exports of common wheat to the Soviet Union; whereas the term of validity of those licences expires on 31 January 1991; whereas  failure to effect export by that date entails a loss of the security; Whereas  because of its size  the whole quantity involved cannot be exported before the expiry of the term of validity of the licences owing to the considerable difficulties involved in maritime transport to the Soviet Union; whereas the Soviet Union is  also a major importer of cereals from the Community; Whereas the quantities in question can no longer be placed in a customs warehouse under satisfactory conditions on expiry of the term of validity of the licences owing to a lack of immediately available storage capacity; Whereas  because of the problems likely to be involved in transport to the Soviet Union  exporters who at 23 November 1990 had fixed refunds on exports of common wheat to the Soviet Union obtained  under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3633/90 (3)  an  extension of one month in the term of validity; whereas  it accordingly seems justifiable to permit the same term of validity for exporters who had fixed export refunds at 16 November 1990 and who are encountering the same problem; Whereas under these conditions and quite exceptionally the term of validity of licences should be extended by one month on application by the party concerned; whereas  in order to avoid any undue advantage  provision should however be made that in his  application the party concerned should forego the payment of the monthly increases in the export refund provided for in Article 16 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 for the extension period permitted in this Regulation; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1752,COMMISSION  REGULATION (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the  grant of export refunds in the sugar sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of  the markets in the sugar sector  (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1101/95  (2)  and in  particular Article 17 (15) thereof; Whereas the Agreement on Agriculture reached during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade  negotiations  hereinafter referred to as the 'Agreement`  requires in particular that the  regulations applicable to exports of sugar be adapted; whereas Title II (Trade with third  countries) of the basic Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 was revised as a result of that Agreement by  Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94  (3); whereas  consequently  the detailed rules of application  for granting export refunds on sugar laid down by Commission Regulations (EEC) No 394/70  (4)  as  last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2529/94  (5)  and (EEC) No 1469/77  (6)  as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 1714/88  (7)  should also be reviewed  the Regulations being repealed while  those provisions still relevant to the application of the refund system are carried over; Whereas candy sugar  which is manufactured from white sugar or refined raw sugar  very often has a  degree of polarization of less than 99 5  %; whereas  in view of the high degree of purity of the  raw material used  the refund on candy sugar should be as close as possible to the refund on white  sugar; whereas a precise definition of candy sugar should be laid down; Whereas the intervention prices for white sugar and raw sugar are fixed without taking account of  the storage levy provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81; whereas  however   account should be taken of the impact of that levy on sugar prices and the export refunds should be  determined accordingly; Whereas  in order to ensure equal treatment of all parties concerned in the Community  a standard  method for determining the sucrose content of certain products should be laid down; whereas special  provisions must be laid down to cover cases where that method does not allow the total sucrose  content to be determined; Whereas  in the case of syrups with a relatively low degree of purity  the sucrose content should  be fixed at a flat rate on the basis of the extractable sugar content; Whereas exports of white sugar to third countries are more and more frequently preceded by storage  in bulk in port warehouses or silos  bagging being carried out at the last minute when the ship is  ready to be loaded or on board the vessel itself; whereas  as a result  such operations imply the  shared use at the port concerned of a silo in which sugar from various sugar companies is stored  and therefore mixed; whereas  as the regulations now stand  in order to qualify for advance payment  of refunds  since sugar must be stored under conditions permitting it to be identified physically   mixing with other sugar is not permitted; whereas this situation thus prevents a major percentage  of Community sugar exported to third countries from qualifying for advance payment of export  refunds; Whereas  furthermore  the special features of white sugar  namely its high degree of technical and  commercial homogeneity  make it possible to relax the regulatory constraints on that product while  still ensuring that the product is actually exported after payment of the refund; whereas  under  these circumstances  mixing white sugar from various sources at one place of storage should under  certain conditions (in particular subject to controls) be permitted for the purposes of the advance  payment of export refunds  by amending the relevant provisions on the sugar sector; Whereas  with a view to granting export refunds on isoglucose and inulin syrup  limits should be  laid down as regards the fructose and polysaccharide content in order to ensure that the refund is  granted only on the true product as such; whereas  as regards inulin syrup  the production quotas  and production levies are established at the same level as for sugar and isoglucose by applying a  coefficient of 1 9; whereas  as a result  the refund on inulin syrup should be established using  that coefficient; whereas the export refund on isoglucose and inulin syrup should be fixed each  month in line with the monthly fixing of other refunds in the sugar sector; Whereas it is economically desirable to provide for the possibility of refunds being adjusted in  cases where changes occur in the intervention prices and the price for molasses between the time  they are fixed and actual export; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Sugar ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4). (3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community. (4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination  quantities  qualities and presentations. (6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

1772,Council Regulation (EC) No 1149/2002 of 27 June 2002 opening an autonomous quota for imports of high-quality beef THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular Article 133 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas: (1) In view of the Community's interest in developing harmonious trade relations with third countries  provision should be made for opening  as an autonomous measure  a Community import tariff quota of 1000 tonnes of high-quality fresh  chilled or frozen beef. (2) In spite of the difficulties experienced in 2001  the beef market is now on the way to becoming more stable. Demand of consumers in the Community is increasing  especially for high-quality beef. An additional reduced-tariff-quota for high-quality beef would satisfy at the same time the consumer interests as well as supplier interests. It would not have a significant impact on the total volume of beef imports into the Community. (3) All operators concerned in the Community should be offered equal and continuous access to that quota. It is also necessary to insure appropriate monitoring. To this end  the utilisation of the quota should be based on the presentation of a certificate of authenticity guaranteeing the type and origin of the products. (4) Under Article 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1)  tariff quotas for the products covered by this Regulation are to be administered by the Commission in accordance with detailed rules adopted under the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the said Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) The request was lodged on 23 June 2005 by the Defence Committee of the Steel Butt-Welding Fittings Industry of the European Union on behalf of four Community producers. B.   PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings  flanges and threaded fittings)  of iron or steel (not including stainless steel)  with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609 6 mm  of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes  normally declared under CN codes ex 7307 93 11  ex 7307 93 19  ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90 originating in the People’s Republic of China (the product concerned). These codes are given for information only. (4) The product under investigation is tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings  flanges and threaded fittings)  of iron or steel (not including stainless steel)  with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609 6 mm  of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes  consigned from the Philippines (the product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned. C.   EXISTING MEASURES (5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 (2) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2212/2003 (3). D.   GROUNDS (6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain tube or pipe fittings  of iron or steel  originating in the People’s Republic of China are being circumvented by means of the transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin via the Philippines of certain tube or pipe fittings  of iron or steel. (7) The evidence submitted is as follows. The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People’s Republic of China and the Philippines to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned  and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin of certain tube or pipe fittings  of iron or steel  originating in the People’s Republic of China via the Philippines. Furthermore  the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined in terms of quantities. Significant volumes of imports of certain tube or pipe fittings  of iron or steel  from the Philippines appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China. Finally  the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of certain tube or pipe fittings  of iron or steel  are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned. Should circumvention practices via the Philippines covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation other than transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin be identified in the course of the investigation  the investigation may cover these practices also. E.   PROCEDURE (8) In the light of the above  the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of certain tube or pipe fittings  of iron or steel  consigned from the Philippines  whether declared as originating in the Philippines or not  subject to registration  in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. (a)   Questionnaires (9) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the Philippines  to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the People’s Republic of China  to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures and to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China and the Philippines. Information  as appropriate  may also be sought from the Community industry. (10) In any event  all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith  but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation  - in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and  if necessary  request a questionnaire - within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation  given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties. (11) The authorities of the People’s Republic of China and the Philippines will be notified of the initiation of the investigation. (b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings (12) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. (c)   Exemption of registration of imports or measures (13) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention. (14) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community  exemptions may be granted  in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation  to producers of the product concerned that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation. F.   REGISTRATION (15) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that  should the investigation result in findings of circumvention  anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from the Philippines. G.   TIME LIMITS (16) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: — interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  — producers in the Philippines may request exemption from registration of imports or measures  — interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. (17) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation. H.   NON-COOPERATION (18) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (19) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made  in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Article 1(5) of that Regulation fixes the period of validity of such import licences at three months. (2) In order to quickly obtain information on the quantities released for free circulation in the Community  the period of validity of licences should be shortened. To ensure the relevant information relates to the calendar year  the period of validity of licences should not extend beyond 31 December. (3) For the same reasons  and notwithstanding Article 35(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (3)  the period during which operators must supply proof to the competent authority that the licences have been used should be shortened. (4) In order to have data on the entire period of implementation of the tariff-only arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005  the reduction in the period for submission of proof of use of licences should also apply to licences valid from 1 January 2006  the date from which Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 applies. (5) Indication of the origin of bananas released into free circulation in the Community is particularly important information for the purposes of monitoring imports under the arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005. To make this information available  provision should be made for import licences to be issued for imports of bananas from a specified origin. To that end  a distinction should be made between bananas originating in ACP countries and those originating in other third countries. (6) To ensure that the market is adequately monitored  it is necessary to define the information on prices and quantities marketed which the Member States must forward to the Commission. (7) In order to detect and prevent false declarations by operators  Member States should notify to the Commission the list of operators operating under Commission Regulations (EC) No 219/2006 (4) and (EC) No 2015/2005 of 9 December 2005 on imports during January and February 2006 of bananas originating in ACP countries under the tariff quota opened by Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas (5). (8) Regulation (EC) No 219/2006 repeals Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 (6)  except for Articles 21  26 and 27 and the Annex thereto  which it provides are to continue to apply to imports carried out under Regulation (EC) No 219/2006. In the interests of clarity and legal certainty  the content of those provisions should be incorporated into Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.

1794,4.2.2010 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 32/2 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 94/2010 of 3 February 2010 fixing an additional quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar in respect of marketing year 2009/2010 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1)  and in particular Article 61  first paragraph  point (d)  in conjunction with Article 4 thereof  Whereas: (1) According to Article 61  first paragraph  point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007  the sugar or isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 56 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed by the Commission respecting the commitments resulting from international agreements concluded by the Union. (2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports  in particular concerning the issue of export licences  are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However  the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets. (3) For marketing year 2009/2010  Commission Regulation (EC) No 274/2009 (3) has fixed the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar at 1 350 000 tonnes. Applications for export licences quickly exceeded that limit. Therefore Commission Regulation (EC) No 1106/2009 (4) has fixed an acceptance percentage for the issuing of export licences and suspended the lodging of export-licence applications for out-of-quota sugar. At the time the limit of 1 350 000 t was fixed  the economic conditions were such that it was not possible to exclude that exports of out-of-quota sugar could be considered as being subsidised because the average cost of production of sugar in the Union could have exceeded the selling price of out-of-quota sugar on the export market. Under such conditions it was therefore not possible to increase the quantities of out-of-quota sugar to be exported beyond the limits resulting from the abovementioned international commitments of the Union. (4) Since the beginning of 2009  the global economic conditions have changed significantly in the sugar sector. In early January 2010  world market prices for white sugar more than doubled and reached approximately EUR 500 per tonne at the London commodity futures market. At the same time  the prices on the sugar market in the Union decreased in line with the institutional reference price. (5) Under the current economic conditions the average production cost of sugar beet in the Union is below the selling price of the out-of-quota sugar beet. Furthermore  the selling price of the out-of-quota sugar on the world market is above the average cost of sugar production in the Union. Therefore  as long as these conditions are valid  the export of out-of-quota sugar cannot be considered as being subsidised. Consequently  exports above the export subsidy commitments of the Union could be made without violating the obligations arising from Union membership of the World Trade Organisation. (6) According to the most recent information  it is certain that due to exceptionally favourable weather conditions in 2009  large quantities of out-of-quota sugar will be produced in the Union. This quantity is currently estimated at around 4 100 000 tonnes. Taking into account all the possible outlets for this sugar  in particular the demand of the chemical industry for industrial sugar  it is estimated that at least 500 000 t would be still available for exports. (7) In view of the surplus foreseen in the Union during marketing year 2009/2010 and the exceptionally high world market prices caused by a very difficult supply situation at this time it is preferable to export the remaining surplus sugar in the Union instead of carrying it forward to the next marketing year. Fixing an additional quantitative limit in respect of marketing year 2009/2010 would allow sugar producers and beet growers in the Union to benefit from the current favourable export possibilities. An additional quantitative limit should therefore be fixed. (8) It is now estimated that world market sugar prices may start decreasing as from the second half of 2010. To make sure that the additional exports of out-of-quota sugar do not interfere with subsidy commitments of the Union  it is appropriate to limit the application for export licences until 30 June 2010 and to reduce the validity of export licences to one month. (9) Exports of sugar from the Union to certain close destinations and to third countries granting EU products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particularly favourable competitive position.

(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2)  provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content  including  where appropriate  other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3)  to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation. (4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation. (6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter  taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g)  the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h)  the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period. (8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. (11) In view of the above  refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) By Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(3) (hereinafter ""the anti-dumping Regulation"") and 1891/97(4) (hereinafter ""the countervailing Regulation"")  definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties (hereinafter ""the duties"") were imposed on imports of farmed (other than wild Atlantic salmon from Norway (hereinafter ""salmon"")  with the exception of imports of salmon exported by the companies from which undertakings had been accepted by the Commission. The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty was set at EUR 0 32(5) per kilo net product weight  and the rate of the definitive countrvailing duty at the level of 3 8 % ad valorem applicable to the net free-at-Community-frontier price  before duties. (2) By Decision 97/634/EC(6)  the Commission accepted an undertaking from the Kingdom of Norway and price undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters. (3) Pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter ""the basic anti-dumping Regulation"") and Article 13(9) and (10) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 (hereinafter ""the basic countervailing Regulation"")  provisional(7) and/or definitive(8) anti-dumping and countervailing duties have been imposed on imports of salmon exported by a number of companies which have either violated or withdrawn their undertakings. The duty rates applied in all these cases are those mentioned in recital 1 above. 2. REVIEW INVESTIGATION (4) In the course of the monitoring of the price undertakings by the Commission  it became apparent that the effectiveness of the different measures was being undermined as  under certain circumstances  certain exporters which were not subject to the price undertakings were able to sell salmon on the Community market at injurious prices  even after payment of the duties. This situation increased the risk that other exporters which were bound by undertakings would almost be forced to lower their prices to compete with these comparatively cheap imports would therefore act in violation of their undertakings. With more than 80 % of salmon being exported by companies bound by undertakings  this would therefore undermine the overall effectiveness of the existing measures. (5) Therefore  the Commission announced  by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(9)  the initiation of an ex officio investigation pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 19(1) of the basic countervailing Regulation in order to review the possibility of a change in the form of the duties so that imports of salmon at injurious prices would be prevented. (6) The Commission advised the producers  exporters and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country  the producing and exporting industries in Norway  and the complainant Community producers of the initiation of the review investigation. In the notice of initiation  the Commission already indicated that  for low priced imports  the form of the duties might be changed to a variable duty at the level published in that notice. Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within a set time limit. Several parties made comments in writing but no hearings were requested. 3. APPRAISAL OF THE CURRENT MARKET SITUATION (7) It should first be recalled that the product concerned by the proceeding is farmed Atlantic salmon  whether or not filleted  fresh  chilled or frozen  currently classified under CN codes ex 0302 12 00  ex 0304 10 13  ex 0303 22 00 and ex 0304 20 12  corresponding to fresh or chilled whole fish  fresh or chilled fillets  frozen whole fish  and frozen fillets  respectively. (8) In monitoring the undertakings  the Commission found that during the second half of 1998  the price level reported for exports of salmon gradually deteriorated  on a weekly basis  to a level which was below the non-injurious price level established during the investigations which led to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures. This development is confirmed by the Norwegian export statistics and by wholesale selling prices found in the Community. The prices of salmon imports from Norway were therefore lower than could have been expected after the imposition of the original measures and under normal market conditions. (9) The monitoring of the undertakings and the present investigation have shown that the downward price pressure towards an injurious level was caused  to a large extent  by Norwegian exporters not bound by price undertakings which started to sell salmon at prices which  even after payment of the duties  are below the non-injurious price level. Indeed  as was established during the investigations which led to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures  salmon is traded as a commodity in a relatively transparent and competitive market. Under these market conditions  increasing sales of salmon on the Community market at prices below the non-injurious price levels set in the undertakings would make it more and more difficult for exporters bound by undertakings to continue to respect their price obligations. Consequently  these exporters find themselves under pressure to act in breach of their undertakings by selling at an injurious price level  or face a situation where their market share is lost to other exporters which sell outside the framework of the undertakings at an injurious price level. The Community industry  the Norwegian Government and the Norwegian producers and exporters associations all shared this assessment. (10) In addition  comments received from certain Norwegian exporters on the findings of the present review investigation also corroborate this assessment. All parties which made submissions following the initiation of the present investigation confirmed that the measures had not led to the intended price stabilisation  and most of them supported the need to review the form of the duties. (11) It is therefore concluded that  in their current form  the duties are not having the intended effect  notably as regards underpinning the undertakings  which were initially accepted from all known exporters and thus constitute the principal measure adopted to counteract injurious dumping and subsidisation. 4. REVISION OF THE FORM OF DUTIES (12) It is the purpose of anti-dumping or countervailing measures to eliminate injurious dumping or subsidisation respectively. The choice of the appropriate form of anti-dumping or countervailing duties for achieving this purpose depends on the circumstances of the case under consideration. (13) Since the early 1990s  the Community salmon market has suffered recurrent crises caused by abnormally low import prices. Therefore  on the basis of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3687/91 of 28 November 1991 on the common organisation of the market in fishery products(10)  the Community  starting with Regulation (EEC) No 3270/91(11)  repeatedly established minimum prices  initially for Atlantic salmon and  since March 1994  for farmed Atlantic salmon. In December 1995  on the basis of Articles 112(1) and 113(3) of the Agreement on the European Economic Area(12)  a safeguard measure in the form of a floor price was imposed on farmed Atlantic salmon by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2907/95(13). Customs investigations revealed that  over the whole period  the declared values on importation frequently did not correspond with the prices actually charged by the Norwegian exporters to independent EU customers(14). It was noted  that this happened particularly where salmon was traded between related parties in Norway and the Community. (14) Based on the above experience  it was decided in 1997 to impose the anti-dumping duty in the form of a specific duty  and the countervailing duty in the form of an ad valorem duty in order to ensure the effectiveness of these duties. Given the prevalence of trade between related parties  these duties should  in principle  be maintained to prevent circumvention of the duties. (15) However  the present investigation has shown that these duties leave open the possibility for exporters not bound by undertaking to export salmon at very low prices  which is likely to prejudice respect for the undertakings and thus their continued general use. (16) The current form of the duties should therefore be partially revised in order to deal with such low priced imports and thereby ensure that all salmon originating in Norway is imported at a non-injurious price level. Consequently  in circumstances where the existing duties would be insufficient to ensure a non-injurious import price  the anti-dumping duty should be replaced by a minimum price and become a variable duty. (17) Salmon is commonly traded in different presentations (gutted head-on  gutted head-off  whole fish fillets  other fillets or fillet portions  or off-cuts or trimmings). Therefore  when translating the existing duties into their new form  a non-injurious minimum price level had to be established for each of these presentations with a view to ensuring a level of protection similar to the minimum prices set in the undertakings. The different minimum prices are essentially derived from the weight conversion factor relevant to each presentation by reference to its whole fish equivalent. The presentations and the corresponding weight conversion rates and minimum price levels were published in the Annex to the Commission notice announcing the initiation of the present investigation. No comments have been received in this respect. 5. DURATION OF THE REVISED DUTIES (18) It should be recalled that according to Article 11(2) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 18(1) of the basic countervailing Regulation  the revision of the form of the duty resulting from the present investigation does not change the normal duration of the anti-dumping and countervailing measures since the review has not covered issues of dumping and injury. 6. REPLACEMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 1890/97 AND REGULATION (EC) No 1891/97 (19) The separate anti-dumping and countervailing Regulations were adopted following the initiation of two separate investigations concerning imports of dumped and subsidised salmon(15). In order to simplify the application of the duties  it is appropriate to replace those Regulations by a single Regulation. However  the facts and considerations established in the anti-dumping and countervailing Regulations remain valid as constituting the facts and considerations of the present Regulation ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That Directive provides that aquaculture animals and products thereof are to be introduced into the Community only from third countries or parts of third countries that appear on a list drawn up and updated in accordance with the procedure referred to therein. (2) Article 11 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 of 12 December 2008 implementing Council Directive 2006/88/EC as regards conditions and certification requirements for the placing on the market and the import into the Community of aquaculture animals and products thereof and laying down a list of vector species (2) lays down the rules applicable to the import of ornamental aquatic animals intended for closed ornamental facilities. (3) Pursuant to Article 11(2) of that Regulation  Member States are to authorise the imports of ornamental fish which are not of susceptible species to any of the diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC  and ornamental mollusc and ornamental crustaceans intended for closed ornamental facilities only from third countries or territories that are members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). That provision ensures that relevant epidemiological data related to those animals is made available to all OIE members. (4) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 lays down a list of third countries  territories  zones or compartments from which imports are permitted of aquaculture animals intended for farming  put and take fisheries and open ornamental facilities  and of ornamental fish susceptible to one or more of the diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC and intended for closed ornamental facilities. (5) The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) is an international organisation that provides technical assistance  policy advice  training and research services to 22 Pacific Island countries and territories in areas such as health  human development  agriculture  forestry and fisheries. Certain SPC members are not members of the OIE. (6) The OIE and the SPC concluded an Agreement in September 1999. Pursuant to that Agreement  the SPC is to encourage those of its members that are not members of the OIE to participate in the OIE information network for animal health and aquatic animal health. (7) The Annex to that Agreement  concluded by the SPC and the OIE on 10 April 2003  lays down the terms of collaboration between both parties for the development  maintenance and distribution of a Regional Animal Health Information System for the Pacific Island Countries and its Territories. (8) By letters of 31 March 2009 and 30 April 2009  the SPC informed the Commission that SPC members that are not members of the OIE are able to upload relevant disease information in the OIE World Animal Health Information System in accordance with OIE criteria  as from May 2009. (9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008  in order to authorise imports of ornamental fish which are not of susceptible species to any of the diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC  and ornamental molluscs and ornamental crustaceans  intended for closed ornamental facilities also from third countries and territories that are not members of the OIE but have an official agreement with that organisation in order to participate in its information network for animal health and aquatic animal health. (10) The United States have confirmed that Puerto Rico  US Virgin Island  American Samoa  Guam and Northern Mariana Islands are considered territories of the United States and the competent authority of the United States is responsible for notification of animal diseases to the OIE. (11) Annex III to that Regulation should also be amended accordingly  to include the relevant SPC members. (12) Pursuant to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products (3)  Member States were to ensure that imports of aquaculture animals and products from third countries were subject to conditions at least equivalent to those applying to the production and placing on the market of Community products. (13) While Directive 91/67/EEC was in force  imports from the United States of crustaceans for farming  put and take fisheries  and open ornamental facilities were permitted in the Member States. That Directive was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/88/EC  which harmonised the animal health requirements for such imports. (14) Article 20(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 lays down a transitional period during which consignments of crustaceans for farming  put and take fisheries  and open ornamental facilities may continue to be imported in accordance with the regime in place before the entry into force of Directive 2006/88/EC. That transitional period expires on 30 June 2009. (15) Therefore  the United States should be included in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008  pending the completion of on-the-spot inspections carried out in accordance with Directive 2006/88/EC in order to verify conformity with Community aquatic animal health rules. (16) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.

(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2). (3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community. (4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination  quantities  qualities and presentations. (6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

1882,Commission Regulation (EC) No 129/2004 of 26 January 2004 fixing the export refunds on pigmeat THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2)  and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for these products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in pigmeat that the refund should be fixed as set out below. (3) In the case of products falling within CN code 0210 19 81  the refund should be limited to an amount which takes account of the qualitative characteristics of each of the products falling within these codes and of the foreseeable trend of production costs on the world market. It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81. (4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries  which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602  the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances  to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations. (5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination. (6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(4). (7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore  to be eligible for a refund  products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5)  as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6)  Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8)  as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).

In particular there are grounds for suspecting that there have been and still are agreements or concerted practices between steel-producing undertakings  between steel-distributing undertakings and between steel-producing and distributing undertakings  fixing production and supply quotas  supply channels and prices and sharing out markets. In order to ascertain the facts  the Director-General for Competition has ordered checks to be made at a number of steel-producing or distributing undertakings pursuant to the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty. The investigation at Stahlwerke Rรถchling-Burbach GmbH  Vรถlklingen  planned for 7 September 1976  was to have extended to books and papers which were withheld from officials of the Federal Cartel Office during an investigation carried out on 25 August 1976 at the same undertaking  of the grounds that the Federal Cartel Office had no authority in respect of the relevant products. However  Commission investigators discovered during their investigation that the files described by the Federal Cartel Office were no longer kept in the Richardstraรe 12 premises. The company's management stated that the books and papers had been destroyed on its instructions. The fact that no written explanation of this behaviour  as required by the Commission and promised by the undertaking  was ever provided  despite a written reminder on 21 September 1976  gives grounds for suspecting that the books and papers in which the Commission is interested are being kept elsewhere. It is accordingly necessary  to require the undertaking by Decision to submit them for inspection. The undertaking must guarantee that the Commission officials carrying out the investigation will be permitted  during normal office hours  to enter its premises  to inspect the books and papers described in Article 1  to take copies and photocopies as they may require  and to call for immediate verbal and written explanations regarding the matter under investigation. Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty  the full text of which is annexed hereto  empowers the Commission to impose fines of up to one per cent of annual turnover  or periodic penalty payments of up to five per cent of average daily turnover for each day's delay on undertakings which evade their obligations under decisions taken in pursuance of that Article  or which knowingly furnish false information ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(3) The Commission inspection service (Food and Veterinary Office) carried out an inspection of the border inspection post at the port of Astakos in Greece in November 2008  in accordance with Decision 2001/881/EC. (4) The inspection revealed a number of structural weaknesses. The competent authority in Greece has therefore provided an action plan to address those weaknesses. That action plan was found to be satisfactory. The border inspection post at the port of Astakos should therefore be added to the list of approved border inspection posts set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.

1896,31.3.2004 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 94/33 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 596/2004 of 30 March 2004 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the egg sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003 (2)  and in particular Articles 3(2)  8(12) and 15 thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 of 22 December 1994 on the adjustments and transitional arrangements required in the agricultural sector in order to implement the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1340/98 (4)  and in particular Article 3(1) thereof  Whereas (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1371/95 of 16 June of 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the egg sector (5) has been substantially amended several times (6). In the interest of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified. (2) Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that all exports for which export refunds are requested  with the exception of exports of hatching eggs  shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund. Therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the egg sector which should  in particular  include provisions for the submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences  in addition to those contained in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 322/2004 (8). (3) In order to assure proper administration of the system  the rate of the security for export licences under the said system should be fixed. In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the egg sector  export licences should not be transferable and precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down. (4) Article 8(12) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that compliance with the obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences. Therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of licences should be laid down. (5) In addition  the decision regarding applications for export licences should be communicated only after a period of consideration. This period would allow the Commission to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and  if appropriate  to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending. It is in the interest of traders to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the acceptance coefficient has been fixed. (6) In the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes  the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it. However  such licences should be restricted to short-term commercial transactions in order to prevent the mechanism provided for in this Regulation from being circumvented. (7) In order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported  a derogation from the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should be laid down. (8) The Commission should dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and of the use of licences issued  in order to be able to manage this system. In the interest of efficient administration  the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made according to a uniform model. (9) Article 8(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that for hatching eggs export refunds may be granted on the basis of an ex post export licence. Therefore implementing rules for such a system should be laid down with the aim of ensuring efficient verification with the obligations arising from the agreements concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round negotiations are complied with. However  it would appear unnecessary to require the lodging of a security in the case of licences applied for after exportation.

1908,COMMISSION  DECISION of 22 April 1988 concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of certain ball bearings originating in Singapore (NMB Italia SA) (Only the Italian text is authentic) (88/329/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1761/87 (2)  and in particular Article 16 thereof  Whereas: A. Procedure (1) On 19 July 1984  by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 (3)  a definitive anti-dumping duty of 33 89 % was imposed on imports of certain ball bearings manufactured and exported by the Minebea group of companies and originating in Singapore. (2) In 1985 and 1986 NMB (Italia) SA  Bareggio  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japanese mother company of the Minebea group  applied  on a regular basis  for the refund of anti-dumping duties amounting in total to Lit . . . (4) paid on imports of the ball bearings during the two years in question. This amount represents part of the anti-dumping duties paid; a refund of the remainder was not requested. (3) Following submissions by the applicant  additional information on certain costs  prices  commercial conditions and commercial activities of the Minebea group outside Singapore was requested by the Commission on the basis of the Commission notice concerning the reimbursement of antidumping duties (5) (hereinafter referred to as Notice). The applicant complied with all requests for additional information to the satisfaction of the Commission. Subsequently  the applicant was informed of the preliminary results of this examination and given an opportunity to comment on it. It did so  and the comments were taken into consideration prior to this Decision. (4) The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. No Member State disagreed with this opinion. B. Argument of the applicant (5) The applicant has based its claims on the allegation that  for certain sales in the Community  export prices were such that either dumping did not exist or that dumping existed at a level lower than the level of the definitive duty of 33 89 %. C. Admissibility (6) The applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation  in particular that concerning time limits. D. Merits of the claim (7) The applications are founded in part; for the rest they are unfounded. According to Article 16 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84  anti-dumping duties paid by an importer shall be reimbursed if the importer shows that the duty collected exceeds the actual dumping margin  consideration being given to any application of weighted averages. Pursuant to Article 16 (1) and Part II of the Notice the applicant proved that the duty collected exceeded the actual dumping margin to varying degrees depending on the shipment and the bearing type partly as a result of normal value having decreased. To this extent the applications were founded and the applicant agrees with the Commission's calculation. The amount to be refunded is Lit . . . (8) The applicant requests  however  the refund of an additional amount. For the determination of this additional amount  the applicant agrees with the Commission that  when calculating the dumping margin for the purpose of establishing whether it was exceeded by the level of duty or not  the export prices have to be constructed in accordance with Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84. Article 2 (8) (b) provides that an export price is constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported product is first resold to an independent buyer and that allowance shall be made for all costs incurred by the related importer between importation and resale  including customs duties  any anti-dumping duties and other taxes  and for a reasonable profit margin. The applicant maintains  however  that in constructing the export price  the anti-dumping duty should not be deducted; this would then result in a lower dumping margin for the refund calculation and consequently in a higher amount to be refunded. The applicant justifies its request by claiming that  as a result of the Commission's position  imports by independent importers are treated differently from imports by related importers. The Commission has evaluated this argument; it does not find it acceptable. It is of the opinion that the wording of Article 2 (8) (b) is clear: all duties  including anti-dumping duties have to be deducted from the resale price. The Commission would  therefore  by granting the applicant's request  infringe the express requirement of Article 2 (8) (b) and of Part II 2 (b) and (c) of the Notice. Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 establishes different rules for the determination of the export price in different situations depending on whether the importer is related to the exporter or not. This cannot be considered discriminatory. The second essential argument by the applicant  who sold on a duty-paid basis  is that a simple increase of its resale price in the Community by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty  would not allow it to qualify for a refund. The Commission stresses that  had the applicant sold on a duty-unpaid basis  a single increase would have been sufficient to allow it to qualify for a refund. Even where  as in the applicant's situation  the imported product was resold in the Community on a duty-paid basis  only one increase of the resale price by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty is necessary  provided that the Commission is satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the case under consideration this increase in the price paid by the independent buyer eliminates or reduces the dumping margin and does not represent merely the anti-dumping duty which the importer could pass back to its customer if it obtained a refund. This could be the case  for example  if either the costs incurred between importation and resale by NMB or Minebea's normal value had been reduced since the original investigation period. In addition  other changes in circumstances could require the application of different adjustment or calculation methods which could lead to the same result  i.e. the elimination or reduction of the dumping margin by a single price increase. In the present case there is no evidence that these conditions are met. For these reasons the applicant's request for the refund of an additional amount has to be rejected ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1909,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1721/2001 of 30 August 2001 fixing the rates of refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1)  and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15)  Whereas: (1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a)  (c)  (d)  (f)  (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in the Annex to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2390/2000(3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. (2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardized by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (6) Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not provide for the compensation system for storage costs to be extended after 1 July 2001. This should therefore be taken into account when fixing the amounts of refunds  in particular with regard to the advance-fixing options. (7) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ‘cereal products’  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ‘other cereals’  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) The current situation on the cereals market and  in particular  the supply prospects mean that the export refunds should be abolished.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

REQUEST FOR A REVIEW (1) The Commission has received an application for a ""new exporter"" review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation. The application was lodged by Indo Pet (Thailand) Ltd. (the applicant)  an exporting producer in Thailand (the country concerned). B. PRODUCT (2) The product under review is polyethylene terephtalate (PET) with a coefficient of viscosity of 78 ml/g or higher  according to DIN (Deutsche Industrienorm) 53728 originating in Thailand (the product concerned)  currently classifiable within CN code 3907 60 20. This CN code is given only for information. C. EXISTING MEASURES (3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000(3) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned  are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of EUR 83 2 per tonne. D. GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW (4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based  i.e. the period from 1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures. (5) The applicant further alleges that they have begun exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period. E. PROCEDURE (6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received. (7) Having examined the evidence available  the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ""new exporter"" review  pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation  with a view to determine the applicant's individual margin of dumping and  should dumping be found  the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject. (a) Questionnaires (8) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant. (b) Collection of information and holding of hearings (9) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. (10) Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. F. REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (11) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation  the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time  such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation  in order to ensure that  should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicants  anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding. G. TIME LIMITS (12) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: - interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mention in paragraph E(a) of this Regulation or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  - interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. H. NON-COOPERATION (13) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to  or otherwise does not provide  the necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (14) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of the facts available ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2071,COMMISSION DECISION of 14 September 1981 on the joint formation of Eurocoal SA  Brussels  by Etmofina SA  Brussels  and Krupp Handel GmbH  Düsseldorf (Only the Dutch  French and German texts are authentic) (81/789/ECSC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community  and in particular Article 66 thereof  Having regard to Decision No 24/54 of 6 May 1954 laying down in implementation of Article 66 (1) of the Treaty a Regulation on what constitutes control of an undertaking (1)  Having regard to the application made on 4 February 1981 by Petrofina SA  Brussels  and Krupp Handel GmbH  Düsseldorf  for authorization of the joint formation of Eurocoal SA  Brussels  by Etmofina SA  Brussels  and Krupp Handel GmbH  Düsseldorf  Having obtained the comments of the Governments of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany  Whereas: I  1. Eurocoal is intended to handle in combination the coal trade interests of Krupp Handel and Etmofina in the common market  with the exception of the Federal Republic of Germany  and in a number of non-member countries. It is further intended that Eurocoal will commence operations in the Federal Republic of Germany at an opportune moment. The joint subsidiary is to trade in solid fuels  no express distinction having been made between supplies obtained from the Community and those obtained from non-member countries. It is estimated that its turnover will reach between one and two million tonnes after five years. The founder undertakings will each have a 50 % stake in Eurocoal. 2. Etmofina is a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrofina and is combined with it. Petrofina is a multinational group engaged mainly in all spheres of the oil industry (discovery  extraction  transportation and refining of crude oil petrochemicals and the marketing of finished products). In 1979  the group achieved a turnover of some Bfrs 273 000 million (about 6 800 million ECU). Taking these circumstances into account  Etmofina is not an undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty. 3. Krupp Handel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fried. Krupp GmbH (Krupp Group). The Krupp Group  with which Krupp Handel is combined  is engaged in steel production  shipbuilding  industrial plant production  mechanical engineering  distribution and services (involving  amongst other things  coal). In 1979  the group's turnover amounted to some DM 13 000 million (about 5 150 million ECU). Krupp Handel is an undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty. 4. Both groups are convinced that the changes which have occurred on the world energy market since 1973  together with the ever-decreasing capacity of hydrocarbons to meet energy requirements  will lead to a continuing increase in solid fuel consumption. In their view  this will involve not only the emergence of new requirements  but also requirements stemming from the changeover from fuel oil to solid fuel consumption. II The two groups' trade in solid fuels in the territory covered by the agreement will in future be carried out by the joint subsidiary alone. While Krupp Handel will withdraw from such activity  Petrofina will refrain from becoming active in this market. For the purposes of their joint activity in the field of solid fuels distribution  both groups possess tangible and intangible  (1) Official Journal of the ECSC  11.5.1954  p. 345.  resources which are mutually complementary. These resources include the two parent companies' existing marketing networks and also their existing and potential customers and supply contracts. While Krupp Handel's customers are in some cases consumers of solid fuels and in others of mineral oil products  Petrofina  which trades in mineral oil products has customers who are potential converts from mineral oil products to coal or already use coal to cover part of their energy needs and who thus represent an ideal element of goodwill for Eurocoal as regards trade in coal. Wherever they can be of use  these resources will be transferred or made available to the joint subsidiary. Under these conditions  the formation of Eurocoal does not constitute an agreement between the parent companies on the coordination of their market operations  but the creation of an autonomous business entity. The proposed transaction will therefore lead to a concentration within the meaning of Article 66 (1) of the Treaty in the form of group control. The agreements on the equal participation in Eurocoal and on its management will prevent either parent company from exercising individual control over the company. It will be controlled jointly by the parent companies  the latter acting as a group in the pursuit of their common business interests. The joint undertaking will therefore be merged with Petrofina and Fried. Krupp GmbH and with the undertakings controlled by them  without the two groups being merged with each other. Such concentrations may be approved if it can be shown that certain restraints of competition are not involved. This condition is met for the following reasons: The proposed transaction is of only limited significance in the territory of the common market. In 1980  consumption of solid fuels - excluding supplies to State railways and the steel industry  which are generally reserved for mining undertakings - amounted to some 225 million tonnes. This amount is distributed partly by the producers  which in some cases fulfil a distributive function  and partly by a large number of wholesale coal distributors. The latter include several which each year sell more than two million tonnes of solid fuels. Under the given circumstances  Eurocoal's planned turnover  even when increased to include Krupp Handel's supplies in the Federal Republic of Germany  is not likely to achieve a market share of more than some 2 % in solid fuels within the common market. Even in the future  there will thus be sufficient competition on this market. Even though it must be remembered that  through its stake in Eurocoal  Petrofina will cease to be a potential competitor in the marketing of solid fuels  it is clear that the parent companies will not be able  through Eurocoal  to determine prices  to control or restrict production or distribution or to hinder effective competition in a substantial part of the market in solid fuels. Nor will the proposed transaction enable them to evade the rules of competition  in particular by establishing an artificially privileged position involving a substantial advantage in access to supplies or markets. A group effect between Fried. Krupp GmbH and Petrofina will not be created  since the latter has hitherto not been involved in the production or distribution of solid fuels.
