1799,23.2.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 52/34 COMMISSION DECISION of 13 February 2006 requiring Member States temporarily to take additional measures against the dissemination of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode) as regards areas in Portugal  other than those in which it is known not to occur (notified under document number C(2006) 345) (2006/133/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1)  and in particular Article 16(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Where a Member State considers that there is an imminent danger of the introduction into its territory of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode (PWN))  from another Member State  it should be authorised to temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger. (2) Portugal informed the other Member States and the Commission on 25 June 1999 that some samples of pine trees originating in its territory were identified as infested by PWN. The Commission has adopted Decisions 2000/58/EC (2) and 2001/218/EC (3) defining measures to be taken against PWN. (3) On the basis of assessments by the Food and Veterinary Office  most recently in November 2004  additional information submitted by Portugal and official surveys carried out by the other Member States on wood  isolated bark and plants of Abies Mill.  Cedrus Trew  Larix Mill.  Picea A. Dietr.  Pinus L.  Pseudotsuga Carr. and Tsuga Carr.  it appears that as a result of the application of an eradication programme in Portugal  the spread of PWN remains limited to the demarcated areas in Portugal. However  trees showing symptoms of infestation by PWN were still found during surveys of those areas. (4) The implementation of the Portuguese mid-term eradication plan for PWN of February 2003  as amended in June 2003  was evaluated by the Standing Committee on Plant Health in its meetings of July 2004 and May 2005. During the latter meeting it was concluded that the aimed reduction of infection level in the demarcated zone had not been fully achieved so far. (5) It is therefore necessary for Portugal to continue to take specific measures with respect to movements of wood  isolated bark and host plants within demarcated areas in Portugal and from such areas into other areas of Portugal and into the other Member States. (6) It is also necessary that Portugal continues to take measures to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradication. Therefore  an updated mid-term eradication plan to better control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating should be presented. (7) The other Member States should continue to have the possibility to apply additional measures to protect their territories from PWN. (8) The results of the specific measures and of the implementation of the mid-term plan should be assessed continuously  in particular on the basis of information to be provided by Portugal and the other Member States.

(2) Under that Regulation it is possible  in certain circumstances  to use other allocation methods  to divide quotas into tranches  or to reserve a proportion of a specific quantitative limit exclusively for applications which are supported by evidence of the results of past import performance. (3) Rules for management of the quotas established for 2014 should be adopted before the quota year begins so that the continuity of trade flows is not affected unduly. (4) The measures adopted in previous years  such as those in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1163/2012 (2)  proved to be satisfactory and it is therefore appropriate to adopt similar rules for 2014. (5) In order to satisfy the greatest possible number of operators it is appropriate to make the ‘first come  first served’ allocation method more flexible by placing a ceiling on the quantities which can be allocated to each operator by that method. (6) To guarantee a degree of continuity in trade and efficient quota administration  operators should be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2014 equivalent to the quantity which they imported in 2013. (7) To achieve optimum use of the quantities  an operator who has used up at least one half of the amount already authorised should be permitted to apply for a further amount  provided that quantities are available in the quotas. (8) To secure a sound administration  import authorisations should be valid for nine months from the date of issue but only until the end of the year at the latest. Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify  in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary  that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should  however  be authorised  in response to importers’ applications  to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2015 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date.

1957,Commission Decision of 5 April 2004 terminating the investigation into the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2320/97  as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 235/2004  on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 348/2000  as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2002 on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Ukraine by wrong declaration of imports of the same product and by imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of alloy steel  other than stainless steel  originating in Russia and Ukraine and terminating the registration of such imports imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1264/2003 (2004/316/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004(2)  and in particular Article 9 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE 1. Existing measures (1) By Council Regulation (EC) No 2320/97(3)  as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 235/2004((4))  and by Regulation (EC) No 348/2000(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1515/2002(6)  (the original Regulations)  the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping duties of 26 8 % on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating  inter alia  in Russia and of 38 5 % on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating  inter alia  in Ukraine. (2) On 23 November 2002  the Commission initiated an interim and expiry review of the abovementioned measures concerning imports from Russia(7) pursuant to Articles 11(2) and 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation) and an interim review of the abovementioned measures concerning imports from Ukraine(8) pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation. These investigations are still ongoing. 2. Request (3) On 2 June 2003  the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine. The request was submitted by the Defence Committee of the Seamless Steel Tube Industry of the European Union (the Applicant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion  i.e. over 50 % of the Community production of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel. (4) The request contained sufficient prima facie evidence that there had been a significant change in the pattern of trade  as imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine have decreased substantially following the imposition of measures on the products concerned  while certain seamless pipes and tubes of alloy steel  other than stainless steel  declared under Combined Nomenclature(9) (CN) codes 7304 59 91 and 7304 59 93 and originating in Russia and Ukraine had increased during the same time span. (5) This change in the pattern of trade was alleged to stem either from the practice that minimal quantities of other substances are being added to the product concerned  so that they fall outside the CN codes corresponding to the definition of the products subject to the measures (CN codes ex 7304 10 10  ex 7304 10 30  7304 31 99  7304 39 91 and 7304 39 93 )  notwithstanding the fact that the basic characteristics and uses of the products remain unchanged  or from the practice of wrongly declaring the product concerned under CN codes outside the scope of the anti-dumping measures. It was further alleged that there was insufficient due cause or economic justification for these practices other than the existence of the anti-dumping duties on certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine. (6) Finally  the Applicant alleged that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping duties on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine were being undermined  both in terms of quantities and prices  and that dumping was taking place in relation to the normal values previously established. 3. Initiation (7) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1264/2003(10) (the initiating Regulation)  the Commission initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine and  pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation  directed the customs authorities to register imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel  and of certain seamless pipes and tubes of alloy steel  other than stainless steel declared under CN codes 7304 59 91 and 7304 59 93 and originating in Russia and Ukraine as from 17 July 2003. 4. Investigation (8) The Commission advised the authorities of Russia and Ukraine of the initiation of the investigation. Questionnaires were sent to the producers and exporters in Russia and Ukraine as well as to the importers in the Community named in the request or known to the Commission from the previous investigations. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. (9) Replies to the questionnaires were submitted by five producers in Russia  three producers in Ukraine  one exporter in Russia  two exporters in Ukraine and one trader in Switzerland. Replies to the questionnaire were also submitted by eight traders/importers in the Community. The Commission carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies: Russian producers: - Taganrog Mettalurgical Works  Taganrog  Russia  - OJSC Volzhsky Pipe Works  Volzskhy  Russia; Russian exporter: - CJSC Trade House TMK  Moscow  Russia; Ukrainian producers: - Dnepropetrovsk Tube Works  Dnepropetrovsk  Ukraine  - Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant  Dnepropetrovsk  Ukraine  - Nikopolsky Seamless Tubes Plant  Dnepropetrovsk  Ukraine; Ukrainian exporters: - Scientific Production Investment Group  Dnepropetrovsk  Ukraine; - AACS  Dnepropetrovsk  Ukraine; Trader related to the Ukrainian company Scientific Production Investment Group: - Sepco S.A  Lugano  Switzerland; Unrelated importers/traders in the Community: - RWH  Germany  - Eurosinara SRL  Italy  - Merigo SPA  Italy. 5. Investigation period (10) The investigation period covered the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 (the IP). Data was collected from the year 2000 up to the IP to investigate the change in the pattern of trade. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION (11) By a letter of 9 February 2004  the applicant formally withdrew its request to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine. (12) An investigation of alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures may  in cases where the request for investigation has been withdrawn  be terminated. By the analogous application of the provisions of Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation  such termination may take place unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. (13) The Commission considered that  in the absence of information showing that termination of the investigation would not be in the Community interest  the present investigation should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest. (14) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-circumvention investigation concerning imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine by imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of alloy steel  other than stainless steel  normally declared under CN codes 7304 59 91 and 7304 59 93 or by wrong customs declarations  should be terminated. (15) The registration of imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel  and of certain seamless pipes and tubes of alloy steel  other than stainless steel declared under CN codes 7304 59 91 and 7304 59 93 and originating in Russia and Ukraine  introduced by the initiating Regulation should therefore be discontinued and that Regulation be repealed ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1958,COMMISSION DECISION of 7 November 1997 accepting undertakings in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of flat pallets of wood originating in the Republic of Poland (97/797/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2)  and in particular Article 8 (1) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) The Commission by Regulation (EC) No 1023/97 (3) imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on certain imports of flat pallets of wood falling within CN code ex 4415 20 20 originating in the Republic of Poland and accepted undertakings offered from certain producers. These undertakings concerned only one pallet type  i.e. the EUR pallet. (2) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1632/97 (4)  the above provisional Regulation was amended adding a provision whereby genuine new Polish exporters can be attributed the weighted average duty applicable to co-operating companies not included in the sample of exporters investigated and can have undertakings accepted with regard to exports of EUR-pallets. (3) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1633/97 (5)  in application of the abovementioned new provision  the provisional Regulation was further amended by including a number of genuine new exporters in the list of companies receiving the weighted average duty and by accepting undertakings from some of such new exporters. B. DEFINITIVE DETERMINATION (4) The Commission continued to seek and verify all information that it deemed necessary for the purpose of its definitive findings. In the course of this investigation  it was established that definitive anti-dumping measures in the form of an ad valorem duty and  where applicable  price undertakings  should be taken in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. The findings and conclusions on all aspects of the investigation are set out in the Commission's proposal to the Council to impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of wooden pallets originating in Poland (6). C. NEW EXPORTERS' REQUEST (5) Following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1633/97  eight further new Polish exporting producers have applied not to be treated differently from the companies which co-operated in the proceeding but were not included in the sample and have offered undertakings with regard to the EUR-pallet. They have provided  on request  evidence showing that they are genuine new exporters  which is considered sufficient to accept the undertakings offered by them with regard to the EUR-pallet. (6) Two Polish exporters included in the list of companies receiving the weighted average duty have now offered undertakings with regard to the EUR-pallet which are considered acceptable ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1959,Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2004 of 31 March 2004 providing for reallocation of import rights under Regulation (EC) No 1146/2003 and derogating from that Regulation THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1)  and in particular Article 32(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1146/2003 of 27 June 2003 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen beef intended for processing (1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004)(2) provides for the opening of a tariff quota from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 for 50700 tonnes of frozen beef intended for processing. Article 9 of that Regulation provides for the reallocation of unused quantities on the basis of the actual utilisation of import rights for A-products and B-products respectively by the end of February 2004. (2) An operator submitted an application for import rights for 225 tonnes of beef for the production of A-products under Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1146/2003. As a result of an administrative error by the competent Danish authority  the application from that operator  forwarded to the Commission in accordance with Article 5(3)  concerned 40 tonnes only. The national administration discovered the error only on completion of the procedure for the allocation of import rights referred to in Article 5(4) and notified the Commission accordingly. In order that the operator who submitted the application correctly should not be put at a disadvantage  the necessary measures should be taken to permit the competent Danish authority to remedy the administrative error in an appropriate way. Consequently  by derogation from Article 9 of the above Regulation steps should be taken  firstly  to reduce the overall quantity established in accordance with paragraph 1 of that Article by a quantity corresponding to the difference between the import rights which the operator could legitimately have hoped to receive on the basis of his application and the import rights which he actually received and  secondly  to provide that the competent Danish authority may allocate import rights to the operator concerned on the basis of the application which he submitted under Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1146/2003. (3) Taking account of this error has resulted in an administrative delay. The deadlines for application and communication referred to in Article 9(4) should be extended therefore. (4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) These quantities were set  for the 2005/06 delivery period  by Commission Regulation (EC) No 180/2006 (3). (3) Article 7(1) and (2) of the ACP Protocol lays down rules for cases where an ACP State fails to deliver its agreed quantity. (4) The competent authorities of Saint Kitts and Nevis and of Trinidad and Tobago have informed the Commission that they will be unable to deliver their agreed quantities in full and that they do not wish to have the additional period for delivery. (5) After consultation with the ACP States concerned  a reallocation of the shortfall must therefore be carried out for delivery during the 2005/06 delivery period. (6) Regulation (EC) No 180/2006 should therefore be repealed  and the delivery obligations for the 2005/06 delivery period should be adjusted in accordance with Article 9(1) and (2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003.

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) In accordance with the second paragraph  subparagraph (a) of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed for a period of the same duration as that for which refunds are fixed for the same products exported unprocessed. (4) Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lays down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (5) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (6) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

(2) The rules in question should therefore be recast and Regulation (EEC) No 920/89 deleted. To that end and in the interests of preserving transparency on the world market  account should be taken of the standard for citrus fruit recommended by the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). (3) Application of this standard should remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market  bring production into line with consumer requirements and facilitate trade based on fair competition  thereby helping to improve profitability. (4) The standards are applicable at all marketing stages. Long-distance transport  storage over a certain period and the various processes the products undergo may cause certain deterioration owing to the biological development of the products or their relatively perishable nature. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standard at the marketing stages following dispatch. As products in the ""Extra"" class have to be particularly carefully sorted and packaged  only lack of freshness and turgidity is to be taken into account in their case.

The applicant claimed that it was not related to any other exporters of the product concerned in India. Furthermore  it claimed that it had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (i.e. from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998)  but had exported the product concerned to the Community after that period. On the basis of the above  it requested that an individual duty rate be established for it. 2.   Initiation of an accelerated review (3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  the Commission initiated  by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union  (3)  an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the company concerned and commenced its investigation. 3.   Product concerned (4) The product covered by the current review is the same product as that under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999  namely stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more  containing by weight 2 5 % or more of nickel  excluding wire containing by weight 28 % or more but no more than 31 % of nickel and 20 % or more but no more than 22 % of chromium. 4.   Investigation period (5) The investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003 (the review investigation period). 5.   Parties concerned (6) The Commission officially advised the applicant and the Government of India (GOI) of the initiation of the procedure. Furthermore  it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However  no such views or any request for a hearing was received by the Commission. (7) The Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant and received a full reply within the required deadline. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the applicant. C.   SCOPE OF THE REVIEW (8) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made in by the applicant  the review was limited to subsidisation. (9) The Commission examined the same subsidy schemes which were analysed in the original investigation. It also examined whether the applicant had used any subsidy schemes which were alleged to confer benefits in the original complaint but not found to have been used during the original investigation. D.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION 1.   New exporter qualification (10) The applicant was able to satisfactorily demonstrate that it was not related  directly or indirectly  to any of the Indian exporting producers subject to the countervailing measures in force with regard to the product concerned. (11) The investigation confirmed that the applicant had not exported the product concerned during the original investigation period  i. e. from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998. (12) It was established that the applicant had only realised one sale to the Community which actually took place in August 2001  i. e. after the original investigation period but well before the review investigation period. (13) In reply to the questionnaire  the applicant identified only one contract that had been signed during the review investigation period  but the on-spot verification confirmed that the sale had never been materialised. Consequently  there was no irrevocable contractual obligation undertaken by the applicant to export to the Community. (14) However  it is noted that the company had significant export sales to other countries during the review investigation period which allowed for the calculation of the benefit accruing to export sales from subsidisation  since such benefits accrue regardless of the destination of these sales. 2.   Subsidisation (15) On the basis of the information contained in the applicant's reply to the Commission's questionnaire  the following schemes were investigated: — Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme  — Income Tax Exemption Scheme  — Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme  — Export Processing Zones/Export Oriented Units. 3.   Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPB) (16) It was established that the applicant received benefits under this scheme during the review investigation period. It made use of the DEPB on a post-export basis. The detailed description of the scheme is contained in paragraph 4.3 of the Export and Import Policy (Notification No 1/2002-07 of 31 March 2002 of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the Government of India). (17) The characteristics of the DEPB have not changed since the original investigation. The scheme is a subsidy contingent in law upon export performance  and it was therefore determined during the original investigation that it is deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation. (18) It was established that the applicant transferred all the DEPB credits to its related company Viraj Alloys Ltd. The same practice was also followed by three other related Indian companies of the applicant  i.e. Viraj Forgings Ltd  Viraj Impoexpo Ltd and Viraj Profiles Ltd. The investigation confirmed that Viraj Alloys Ltd is the provider of the raw materials of all the previous mentioned companies and used their transferred DEPB credits to make duty-free imports. 4.   Income Tax Exemption Scheme (ITES) (19) It was established that the applicant received benefits under this scheme and in particular under Section 80HHC of the Indian Income Act. (20) The characteristics of the ITES have not changed since the original investigation. It was determined during the original investigation that the ITES is a countervailable subsidy  as the GOI confers a financial contribution to the company by forgoing government revenue in the form of direct taxes on profits from exports which would otherwise be due if the income tax exemptions were not claimed by the company. However  it was found that the ITES under Section 80HHC is gradually being phased out starting from the financial year 2000-2001 until the financial year 2004-2005 when no export profit would be exempted from income tax. During the review investigation period only 50 % of profits obtained from exports were exempted from income tax. (21) The subsidy is contingent in law upon export performance within the meaning of Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation  since it exempts profits from export sales only  and is therefore deemed to be specific. (22) The benefit to the applicant has been calculated on the basis of the difference between the amount of taxes normally due with and without the benefit of the exemption during the review investigation period. The rate of income tax  including corporate tax plus surcharge  applicable during this period was 36 75 %. In order to establish the full benefit to the applicant and given that three companies related to the applicant have also exported the product concerned during the review investigation period (see recital 18)  the amount of subsidy has been established taking into account the income tax exemptions under Section 80HHC of the applicant  Viraj Forgings Ltd  Viraj Impoexpo Ltd and Viraj Profiles Ltd. Given that the subsidy was not granted by reference to the quantities exported  the subsidy amount has been allocated over the total export turnover of the applicant and its related companies in accordance with the provisions of Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation. On this basis  it was established that VSL Wires Limited obtained under this scheme subsidies of 1 4 %. 5.   Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCGS) (23) It was established that the applicant had not availed itself of the EPCGS. 6.   Export Processing Zones (EPZ)/Export Oriented Units (EOU) (24) It was established that the applicant was not located in an EPZ and was not an EOU and  therefore  had not availed of the scheme. 7.   Other schemes (25) It was established that the applicant had neither made use of new subsidy schemes which were established after the end of the original investigation period  nor had it received any ad hoc subsidies after this date. 8.   Amount of countervailable subsidies (26) Taking account of the definitive findings relating to the various schemes as already set out  the amount of countervailable subsidies for the applicant is as follows: DEPB ITES Total VSL Wires Limited 12 7 % 1 4 % 14 1 % E.   AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED (27) Based on the findings made during the investigation  it is considered that imports into the Community of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more produced and exported by VSL Wires Limited should be subject to a level of countervailing duty corresponding to individual amounts of subsidies established for this company during the review investigation period. (28) Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly. F.   DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURES (29) The Commission informed the applicant and the GOI of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to propose that Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 be amended. They were also given a reasonable period of time to comment. (30) In its response to the disclosure  the applicant claimed that the post-export DEPB is a substitution remission/ drawback scheme which was wrongly assessed by the Commission in terms of extent of subsidy and amount of countervailable benefit. It argued that the Commission's assessment of the benefits under this scheme was incorrect since only the excess duty drawback could be considered a subsidy and that the practical operations of the system have not been investigated by the Commission. (31) This review does not affect the date on which Council Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 will expire pursuant to Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2007,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1912/2003 of 30 October 2003 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice-products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003(2)  and in particular Article 13(3) thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4)  and in particular Article 13(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) The requirements in the legislation of Saudi Arabia on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC. (3) In particular  the ‘General Directorate of Quality Control Laboratories (GDQCL)’ is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the rules in force.

2013,Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2002 of 2 April 2002 fixing the export refunds on pigmeat THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2)  and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for these products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in pigmeat that the refund should be fixed as set out below. (3) In the case of products falling within CN code 0210 19 81  the refund should be limited to an amount which takes account of the qualitative characteristics of each of the products falling within these codes and of the foreseeable trend of production costs on the world market. It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81. (4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries  which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602  the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances  to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations. (5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination. (6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 488/2002(4). (7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore  to be eligible for a refund  products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5)  as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6)  Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8)  as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).

(2) Article 2(7) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 lays down that  in the case of imports from non-market-economy countries and  in particular  those listed in a footnote to that provision  normal value shall  inter alia  be determined on the basis of the price or constructed value in an analogous market-economy third country. (3) Article 2(7) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 further lays down that  in the case of imports from the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China  normal value may be determined in accordance with the rules applicable to market-economy countries in cases where it can be shown that market conditions prevail for one or more producers subject to investigation in relation to the manufacture and sale of the product concerned. (4) The process of reform in the Ukraine  Vietnam and Kazakhstan has fundamentally altered the economies of those countries and has led to the emergence of firms for which market-economy conditions prevail. These three countries have as a result moved away from the economic circumstances which inspired the use of the analogue-country method. (5) It is appropriate to revise the Community's anti-dumping practice in order to be able to take account of the changed economic conditions in the Ukraine  Vietnam and Kazakhstan.

The rate of the duty applicable to the net  free-at-Community-frontier price  before duty  is set for imports of the product concerned at 40 1 % manufactured by the Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation and at 14 7 % manufactured by the OOO Viz Stal. 2.   Investigation (2) On 20 March 2004 the Commission announced through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union  (5) the initiation of a partial interim review of the measures in force (‘the measures’) pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 22(c) of the basic Regulation. (3) The review was launched at the initiative of the Commission in order to examine whether  as a consequence of the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 (‘Enlargement’) and  bearing in mind the aspect of Community interest  there is a need to adapt the measures in order to avoid a sudden and excessively negative effect on all interested parties including users  distributors and consumers. (4) All interested parties  including the Community industry  associations of producers or users in the Community  exporters/producers in the countries concerned  importers and their associations and the relevant authorities of the countries concerned as well as interested parties in the ten new Member States which acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004 (‘the EU10’) were advised of the initiation of the investigation and were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing  to submit information and to provide supporting evidence within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing. 3.   Result of the investigation (5) As set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 990/2004  the investigation concluded that it is in the Community interest to adapt the existing measures  provided that such adaptation does not significantly undermine the desired level of trade defence. 4.   Undertakings (6) In accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) 990/2004 the Commission  in conformity with Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation  suggested undertakings to the companies concerned. As a result  undertakings were subsequently offered by (i) one exporting producer of the product concerned in Russia (Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation) jointly with a company in Switzerland (Stinol AG) and (ii) a second exporting producer of the product concerned in Russia (OOO Viz Stal) jointly with its related company Duferco S.A. in Switzerland. (7) It should be noted that  in application of Article 22(c) of the basic Regulation  these undertakings are considered as special measures since  in accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) 990/2004  they are not directly equivalent to an anti-dumping duty. (8) Nevertheless  in conformity with Regulation (EC) 990/2004  the undertakings oblige each individual producing exporter to respect the import ceilings and  in order that the undertakings can be monitored  the exporting producers concerned have also agreed to broadly respect their traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU10. The exporting producers are also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly  or that the undertakings become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor  the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place  or it may adjust the level of the ceiling  or it may take other remedial action. (9) It is also a condition of the undertakings that if they are breached in any way  the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in their place. (10) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community  meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission. (11) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertakings  when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to an undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) 990/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable. (12) In view of all the above  the offers of undertakings are considered acceptable. (13) The acceptance of the undertakings is limited to an initial period of six months without prejudice to the normal duration of the measures and they shall lapse after this period  unless the Commission considers it is appropriate to extend period of application of special measures for next six months. B.   REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (14) In view of the unusual circumstances of this case and the inherent risk of breaches of undertakings caused by the price differences between the EU10 and the EU15 and their short term character  it is considered that sufficient grounds exist to make certain imports of the product concerned subject to registration for a maximum period of nine months in accordance with Article 14 (5) of the basic Regulation. (15) Customs authorities are therefore directed to take the appropriate steps to register imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Russia exported by the companies which have offered acceptable undertakings and for which benefit from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties is sought. (16) In the event of a finding of a breach of the undertakings  duties may be levied retroactively on goods entered into free circulation in the Community from the date of the breach of the undertaking ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2055,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1109/2002 of 26 June 2002 fixing export refunds on nuts THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 911/2001(2)  and in particular Article 35(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001(3) lays down detailed rules on export refunds on fruit and vegetables. (2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that  to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported  the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds. (3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (4) Pursuant to Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Shelled almonds  hazelnuts and walnuts in shell can currently be exported in economically significant quantities. (8) Compared with other fruit and vegetables  nuts are relatively easy to store. Export refunds can accordingly be fixed for longer periods with a view to rational management of the arrangements. (9) The application of the abovementioned rules to the present and forecast market situation  and in particular to fruit and vegetable prices in the Community and international trade  gives the refund rates set out in the Annex hereto. (10) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore  care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables  quotas should be fixed for each product. (11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2002(5)  establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds. (12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(6)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(7)  lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products. (13) Owing to the market situation  in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports  the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A 1  A 2 and A 3 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question. (14) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund  taking account in particular of their perishability.

2074,Commission Regulation (EC) No 2320/2001 of 29 November 2001 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice-products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2)  and in particular Article 13(3) thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2001(4)  and in particular Article 13(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. Whereas the fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

(2) This import quota relates to a maximum annual quantity of 2981600 tonnes  including 572000 tonnes for imports originating in the United States and 38000 tonnes for imports originating in Canada. (3) The opening of this quota means that Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 has to be adapted. In order to enable the quota to be opened on 1 January 2003  provision should be made to derogate from Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 during a transitional period expiring on the date of entry into force of the amendment to that Regulation  but until 30 June 2003 at the latest. (4) To ensure that imports of the common wheat covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative  they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences are to be issued  within the quantities set  at the request of the interested parties  subject where appropriate to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for. (5) To ensure the proper management of these quotas  deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in applications and licences should be specified.

However  that Directive permits derogations from that rule  provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms. (2) Commission Decision 2003/248/EC (2) authorises Member States to provide for temporary derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC to permit the import of plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.)  intended for planting  other than seeds  originating in Argentina. (3) The circumstances justifying the authorisation provided for in Decision 2003/248/EC are still present and there is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions. (4) By Commission Directive 2008/64/EC (3) Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds was removed from point (c) of Section II of Part A of Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC. Therefore this organism should no longer be included in the Annex to Decision 2003/248/EC. (5) Based on the experience gained with the application of Decision 2003/248/EC it is appropriate to extend the period of validity of that authorisation for 10 years.

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 9264 tonnes of rice to certain destinations.

(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

PENDING REQUESTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 11 OF REGULATION (EC) No 88/97 (1) When Regulation (EC) No 71/97 entered into force  the Commission had pending a number of applications pursuant to Article 13 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 from bicycle assemblers  seeking exemption from the extension to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People's Republic of China by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 (hereinafter referred to as 'the extended anti-dumping duty`) of the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 (5). Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 88/97 listed the parties whose requests were considered admissible pursuant to Article 11 thereof. (2) The Commission requested and received the necessary information from those parties and verified it where necessary at the premises of the parties concerned. The examination of the merits of the requests in the light of Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 showed that  for all of these parties  the value of the bicycle parts originating in the People's Republic of China used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of parts used. The examination also showed that for some parties the value added to the parts brought in exceeded 25 % of the manufacturing costs of the finished bicycles. (3) In view of these findings  pursuant to Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97  the parties listed in Annex A to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty. The parties concerned were informed accordingly and given an opportunity to comment. (4) In accordance with Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97  the parties listed in Annex A to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty as from 20 April 1996 and the parties' customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty shall be considered void as from that date. B. REQUESTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 3 OF REGULATION (EC) No 88/97 (5) After the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 a number of bicycle assemblers submitted requests pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty. The Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Communities a list of applicants (6) for which payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5 (1) of that Regulation. (6) The Commission requested and received the necessary information from the parties listed in Annex B to this Decision and found their requests admissible according to Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97. The parties were duly informed of the admissibility of their requests. The information provided was examined and verified where necessary at the premises of the parties concerned. (7) The facts as finally ascertained by the Commission show that the assembly operations of the applicants concerned do not fall within the scope of Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96. That is so because  for all the applicants' bicycle assembly operations  the value of the parts originating in the People's Republic of China which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations  while for some applicants the value added to the parts brought in exceeded 25 % of the manufacturing costs of the finished bicycles. (8) For the above reasons  and in accordance with Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97  the parties listed in Annex B to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty. The parties concerned were informed accordingly and given an opportunity to comment. (9) In accordance with Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 the parties listed in Annex B to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty as from the date of receipt of their request and the parties' customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from that date. C. INFORMATION TO INTERESTED PARTIES (10) Following the adoption of this Decision  an updated list of parties exempted pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 and of parties whose requests pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation are under examination should be published in the 'C` series of the Official Journal of the European Communities in accordance with Article 16 (2) of that Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(4) Fiji is not currently included in the list in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC as a third country from which imports of fishery products intended for human consumption are permitted. (5) Union controls to evaluate the control system in place in Fiji governing the production of fishery products intended for export to the Union  the last of which took place in September 2010  together with guarantees provided by the competent authority of Fiji  indicate that the conditions applicable in that third country to fishery products for human consumption destined for export to the Union are equivalent to those laid down in the relevant Union legislation. Accordingly  Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC should be amended in order to permit imports from Fiji of fishery products for human consumption. (6) Decision 2006/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Certain parts of the territory of China listed in Annex I of Decision 94/984/EC were allowed to use the model B certificate until an inspection revealed problems with certification; because of this  imports of fresh poultrymeat from China from 1 August 1996 were suspended by Commission Decision 96/456/EC. (3) An inspection mission was carried out in October 1999 by the Commission in China and has shown that significant improvement has been achieved by the Chinese veterinary services and written assurances have been given so that the above mentioned suspension can be repealed. (4) The disease situation as concerns Newcastle disease still requires additional guarantees to be fulfilled as laid down in the model B certificate of Decision 94/984/EC.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination. (5) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

(2) In order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the reimport or reintroduction into the Community of out-of-quota sugar or isoglucose  Commission Regulation (EC) No 924/2008 of 19 September 2008 fixing the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2008/09 marketing year (3) excludes certain close destinations from the eligible destinations. (3) Article 4c of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 mentions the documents that can be presented as proofs of arrival at destination in the case where certain destinations are excluded from exports of out-of-quota sugar and/or isoglucose. However  that Article does not permit the acceptance of customs documents referred to in Article 16(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (4)  or a certificate of unloading which should be the principle documents to be submitted as proofs for importation into a third country. The documents listed in Article 4c of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 should be accepted only where exporters cannot obtain the standard customs documents referred to in Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. (4) Sugar exports for humanitarian aid purposes continue to be an important trade activity for some Community sugar exporters. It is often the case with such exports that the standard customs documents cannot be obtained and the documents referred to in Article 4c of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 are difficult to be provided. It is therefore necessary to permit a statement of acceptance of delivery issued by an approved international organisation or a humanitarian organisation be accepted as a proof of arrival at destination in accordance with Article 16(2)(f) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. (5) The communication of Member States on issued export licences as requested by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 should also include the quantities of quota sugar and/or isoglucose exported without refund. (6) Quantities of sugar imported under the inward processing arrangements should be monitored closely. Therefore  the communication of Member States on the relevant quantities should take place on a monthly basis. (7) Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.

2150,COUNCIL DECISION of 28 February 2000 authorising the Federal Republic of Germany to apply measures derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (2000/186/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment(1)  and in particular Article 27 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas: (1) By letters registered at the Commission's Secretariat-General on 8 January and 27 August 1999 respectively the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany communicated a request  under Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC to apply two measures derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of the said Directive. (2) Under Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC the Council  acting unanimously on proposal from the Commission  may authorise any Member State to introduce  or extend the period of validity of  special measures derogating from the provisions of the Directive  in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance. (3) As required under Article 27(3) of Directive 77/388/EEC  the Commission  in a letter dated 11 October  informed the other Member States of the request of the German Government. (4) The first derogating measure is intended completely to exclude the value added tax (VAT) which is charged on expenditure on goods and services from the right to deduct when over 90 % of the goods and services are used for the private purposes of the taxable person  or of his employees  or for non-business purposes in general. This measure represents a derogation from Article 17 and is justified by the need to simplify the procedure for charging the VAT. (5) The second measure derogates from Article 17(2) and Article 6 of Directive 77/388/EEC and is intended to limit to 50 % a taxable person's right under Article 17(2) to deduct VAT in respect of all expenditure on vehichles not used solely for business purposes  and also not to charge the VAT due on passenger cars used for private purposes; this ceiling on a taxable person's right to deduct VAT is justified by the proven difficulty of actually verifying the breakdown between business and private expenditure on this type of good and by the consequent likelihood of tax evasion or abuse; in addition such measure will allow a more simplified system of taxation of the private use of vehicles. (6) Nevertheless  the ceiling on a taxable person's right to deduct VAT may not be applied to expenditure on vehicles which represent a taxable person's current assets; furthermore  the flat-rate ceiling on the right to deduct may not be applied where a vehicle is used up to a maximum of 5 % for private purposes; in these cases the normal rules on deduction set out in Article 17(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC remain applicable. (7) These provisions ensure that this degoration from the principle of a taxable person's right to deduct all the tax paid in connection with his taxable activities does not go beyond what is needed to counteract the risk of tax evasion or avoidance as defined in the Court's case-law(2) interpreting Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC. (8) On 17 June 1998  the Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EC as regards the right to deduct VAT(3); the purpose of the proposal is to harmonise definitively some of the disparate rules regarding ceilings on the right to deduct currently applied in the Member States as these could distort competition in international trade since such differences affect prices for goods and services. (9) The authorisation to apply these derogating measures should therefore limit their period of validity so that this ends with the entry into force of the above proposed Directive  but not later than 31 December 2002 if that Directive is not yet in force by then; such a maximum period of validity would allow evaluation of whether the derogation is still appropriate in the light of progress in discussions in the Council or the proposed Directive at the time. (10) The derogation would have no negative effect on the Communities' own resources provided from value added tax ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

2161,26.1.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 22/1 COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 121/2006 of 23 January 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 1858/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of steel ropes and cables originating  inter alia  in India THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation)  and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) In August 1999  by Regulation (EC) No 1796/1999 (2)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of steel ropes and cables (the product concerned) originating  inter alia  in India. (2) In November 2005  following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1858/2005 (3) decided that the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of the product concerned originating  inter alia  in India should be maintained. (3) By Decision 1999/572/EC (4)  the Commission accepted a price undertaking from an Indian company  Usha Martin Industries and Usha Beltron Ltd. This company has changed its name in the meantime and is now known as Usha Martin Ltd (UML). The change of name has in no way affected the activities of the company. (4) As a result  imports into the Community of the product concerned of Indian origin  produced by UML or by any other related company worldwide  and of a type covered by the undertaking (the product covered by the undertaking)  were exempt from the definitive anti-dumping duties. (5) In this regard  it should be noted that certain types of steel wire rope currently produced by UML were not exported to the Community during the investigation period which led to the imposition of definitive anti-dumping measures and were not  therefore  within the scope of the exemption afforded by the undertaking. Accordingly  such steel-wire ropes were liable to payment of the anti-dumping duty when they entered into free circulation in the Community. B.   FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING (6) The undertaking offered by UML obliges it (and any related company worldwide) to  inter alia  export the product covered by the undertaking to the first independent customer in the Community at or above certain minimum import price levels (MIPs) laid down in the undertaking. These price levels eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. In the case of resale in the Community to the first independent customer by related importers  the resale prices of the product covered by the undertaking  after appropriate adjustments for selling  general and administrative costs and a reasonable profit  must also be at levels which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. (7) The terms of the undertaking also oblige UML to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a quarterly report of its sales (and resale by its related parties in the Community) of the product concerned originating in India to the Community. Such reports are intended to include the products covered by the undertaking which benefit from the exemption to the anti-dumping duty as well as those types of steel-wire ropes not covered by the undertaking and which are therefore liable to the anti-dumping duty. (8) Unless otherwise indicated  it is assumed by the Commission that the sales reports of UML (and the reports of resale of related companies established in the Community) are  as submitted  complete  exhaustive and correct in all particulars. (9) It was also acknowledged by UML that  with regard to the exemption to the anti-dumping duties afforded by the undertaking  such exemption is conditional upon presentation to Community customs services of an ‘undertaking invoice’. Moreover  the company undertook not to issue such undertaking invoices for the sale of those types of products concerned  not covered by the undertaking and which are therefore liable to the anti-dumping duty. (10) It is also a condition of the undertaking that the terms and provisions thereof apply to any related company to UML  worldwide. (11) For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the undertaking  UML also agreed to provide all information considered necessary by the Commission and to allow on-the-spot verification visits at its premises  and those of any related companies  in order to verify the accuracy and veracity of data submitted in the said quarterly reports. (12) In this regard  verification visits were carried out at the premises of UML in India and at those of a related company to UML in Dubai  i.e. Brunton Wolf Wire Ropes FZE (BWWR). (13) The verification visit to the Indian company showed that significant volumes of the product concerned  not covered by the undertaking  had been omitted from the quarterly undertaking sales reports submitted to the Commission. Furthermore  the goods in question had been sold by UML to its related importers in the United Kingdom and Denmark and included on undertaking invoices. (14) The verification visit to the Dubai company showed that certain steel-wire ropes had been exported to the Community from Dubai and declared at import into the Community as having United Arab Emirates origin when in fact they were of Indian origin and therefore liable to the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of steel-wire ropes originating in India. The goods in question had not been reported on the quarterly undertaking sales report nor  as was admitted by the company  had anti-dumping duty been paid on them. The goods had also been resold to the first independent customer in the Community at prices below the MIPs. (15) Commission Decision 2006/38/EC (5)  sets out in more detail the nature of the breaches found. (16) In view of these breaches  acceptance of the undertaking offered by Usha Martin Industries and Usha Beltron Ltd  now known as Usha Martin Ltd (TARIC additional code A024) has been withdrawn by Decision 2006/38/EC. A definitive anti-dumping duty should therefore be imposed forthwith on imports of the product concerned exported to the Community by the company concerned. (17) In accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation  the rate of the anti-dumping duty must be established on the basis of the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. As the investigation in question was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and resulting injury by Regulation (EC) No 1796/1999  it is considered appropriate that the definitive anti-dumping rate should be set at the level and in the form imposed by that Regulation  namely 23 8 % of the net  cif free-at-Community-frontier price  before duty. C.   AMENDMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 1858/2005 (18) In view of the above  Regulation (EC) No 1858/2005 should be amended accordingly ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2168,Commission Regulation (EC) No 646/2004 of 6 April 2004 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1)  and in particular Article 31(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products. (5) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions. (6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream  butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products  ice cream and other foodstuffs(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 635/2000  lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods. (7) By Regulations (EC) No 1039/2003(4)  (EC) No 1086/2003(5)  (EC) No 1087/2003(6)  (EC) No 1088/2003(7)  (EC) No 1089/2003(8) and (EC) No 1090/2003(9) the Council adopted autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia  Slovenia  Latvia  Lithuania  Slovakia and the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to those countries.. Those Regulations provide that with effect from 1 July 2003  processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia  Slovenia  Latvia  Lithuania  Slovakia or the Czech Republic  shall not be eligible for export refunds. (8) Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(10)  provides that with effect from 1 July 2003  the goods referred to in Article 1(2) thereof  which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds. (9) Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(11)  provides that with effect from 1 November 2003  processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta  shall not be eligible for export refunds. (10) With a view to enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004  and in order to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the acceding states on the Community level and to prevent any abuse through the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of products in receipt of export refunds  the setting of all remaining export refunds has been discontinued in the milk and milk products sector  in relation to the products concerned when exported unprocessed to the acceding states. (11) Therefore  with effect from 7 April 2004 no refund should be set for certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Cyprus and Poland and for the goods which are not referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 when exported to Hungary.

That term of validity extends to the end of the fourth month following that of issue of the licence. The term of validity is fixed in accordance with market requirements and the need for sound management. (2) The current situation on the maize market makes it desirable to limit the issuing of licences in order to avoid committing quantities from the new marketing year. Licences to be issued in forthcoming months must be reserved for exports before 8 September 2006. To that end  the term of validity of export licences to be issued for execution up to 7 September 2006 must be limited. A temporary derogation should accordingly be introduced to Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003. (3) In order to ensure sound management of the market and to prevent speculation  provision should be made for customs export formalities for export licences for products processed from maize to be completed by 7 September 2006 at the latest either as direct exports or exports under the arrangements laid down in Articles 4 and 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (3).

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed rules for applications for import licences  the status of applicants and the issue of licences. It applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down by the sectoral regulations. For the sake of clarity  therefore  the administration of the Community tariff quotas for imports of rice originating in Egypt should be adapted by adopting a new regulation and repealing Regulation (EC) No 196/97. (3) Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2184/96 opens an overall tariff quota of 32 000 tonnes of rice falling within CN code 1006 originating in Egypt per marketing year.

Taking into account the potential application of different customs duties  the conditions for the application of the 25 % reduction should be laid down. (4) In the interests of sound administration of the quota  it is necessary to allow operators to submit more than one licence application per quota period and therefore to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006. For the same reason  the specific rules which apply to the drawing up of licence applications  their issue  their period of validity and the notification of information to the Commission should be laid down  as should suitable administrative measures in order to ensure that the volume of the quota fixed is not exceeded. In any event  under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period. Moreover  in order to improve controls on this quota and to simplify its administration  provision should be made for import licence applications to be submitted on a weekly basis  and the security should be fixed at a level appropriate to the risks involved. (5) The rules applicable to the transport document and the proof of preferential origin on release for free circulation of the product are set out in Protocol 4 to Council Decision 2004/635/EC of 21 April 2004 on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States  of the one part  and the Arab Republic of Egypt  of the other part (7). Detailed rules for implementing those provisions should be laid down for the quota in question. (6) These measures should apply from the start of the next marketing year  that is  1 September 2007.

2193,Commission Decision of 11 September 2003 terminating the anti-dumping proceedings concerning imports of disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters originating in the People's Republic of China  Indonesia  Malaysia and Vietnam and terminating the interim review of the anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled  non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan and on imports of certain refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan (2003/645/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2)  and in particular Article 9 and Article 11(3) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) In 1991  the Council  by Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91(3)  imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled  non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in  inter alia  the People's Republic of China. (2) By Regulation (EC) No 192/1999(4) the Council  further to an investigation in accordance with Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation)  extended the above anti-dumping measure to: (a) imports of gas-fuelled non-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned from or originating in Taiwan; and (b) imports of certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan. (3) In 2001  Council Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001(5)  imposed a definitive duty on gas fuelled non-refillable pocket flint lighters falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ) originating in the People's Republic of China and maintained the anti-dumping duties extended by Regulation (EC) No 192/1999 to imports of certain refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan falling within CN code ex 9613 20 90 (TARIC codes 9613 20 90*21 and 9613 20 90*29 ) and to imports of non-refillable lighters consigned from Taiwan and falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ) or originating in Taiwan and falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ). These duties were imposed further to an expiry review concerning the definitive anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91 and extended by Regulation (EC) No 192/1999  in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. (4) In 14 May 2002  the Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping by imports of disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters  whether flint or piezo  with or without a refill valve originating in the People's Republic of China  Indonesia  Malaysia and Vietnam (disposable lighters). (5) The complaint was lodged by the European Federation of Lighter Manufacturers (EFLM) acting on behalf of Community producers representing 90 % of total Community production of disposable lighters pursuant to Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation. (6) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding in accordance with Article 5 of the basic Regulation. (7) Regarding the definitive anti-dumping measures in force against non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan  the Commission considered that should it be determined that  on the basis of the findings of the investigation initiated in accordance with Article 5 of the basic Regulation  measures are to be imposed on disposable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China  the continued imposition of the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 would no longer be appropriate  and Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 would have to be amended or repealed accordingly. Indeed  should the investigation have been formally concluded  one of the consequences could have been the imposition of measures on all disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters  i.e. refillable or non-refillable  piezo or flint originating in the countries subject to the present investigation. On the other hand  measures on refillable or non-refillable flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China were already in place  which could have led to conflict with the new measures. Such conflict would have been avoided by amending or repealing the existing measures. Therefore  it was considered that a review in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation (interim review) should be opened as regards Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 in order to allow any amendment or repeal necessary in the light of the investigation under Article 5 of the basic Regulation concerning all disposable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China  Indonesia  Malaysia and Vietnam. (8) Accordingly  the Commission  after consultation of the Advisory Committee  by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(6)  simultaneously initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters originating in the People's Republic of China  Indonesia  Malaysia and Vietnam and an interim review with regard to Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001. Considering the above  the initiation of this interim review was entirely of an ancillary nature. (9) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country  the representative users and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (10) By a letter of 14 July 2003 to the Commission  EFLM formally withdrew its complaint. (11) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation  the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn  unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. (12) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. (13) One exporting producer from China claimed that the Commission should continue its investigation despite the withdrawal of the complaint and publish the relevant findings  in particular as regards dumping. In this context  the exporting producer concerned argued that he would have an interest in the continuation of the investigation due to his cooperation throughout the proceeding and his efforts to show the absence of dumping as far as his own exports are concerned. (14) The same exporting producer further claimed that it should be avoided in future to initiate anti-dumping proceedings. He alleged that the withdrawal of the complaint would show that the complaint leading to this investigation was unfounded. Therefore  this exporting producer concluded that should there be a finding of absence of dumping  this should be published accordingly. This would prevent the Community industry to lodge a new complaint in the near future. (15) These claims had to be rejected. In accordance with Article 5(1) of the basic Regulation  an anti-dumping investigation shall be initiated in each case the Commission has received a complaint containing merely sufficient prima facie evidence of the existence of injurious dumping. In the present case  it was found that the complaint lodged by the Community industry was sufficiently supported by prima facie evidence  consequently the initiation of the present proceeding was fully justified. In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation an anti-dumping proceeding may be terminated in case the complaint is withdrawn unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. As mentioned above in recital 12  however  there was no evidence or information available that a termination of the proceeding would not be in the Community interest. When examining the Community interest  and in accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation  the interests of the exporting producers cannot be taken in consideration. In this context it should be noted that no comments were received from parties mentioned in Article 21 of the basic Regulation  such as users  importers or consumers indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Therefore  it was concluded that there was no reason to continue the investigation  and accordingly  the proceeding should be terminated without formal determinations concerning the existence or absence of dumping and injury nor any other aspect of the investigation. (16) The same exporting producer claimed that the definitive anti-dumping measures in force against non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan should be repealed in case of the termination of the proceeding. In this context  the exporting producer concerned argued that the current investigation covers the same like product and that therefore the continuation of the definitive measures on non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan would be in breach of Article 1(4) and 9(5) of the basic Regulation. (17) It should be noted that no formal conclusions have been reached on any of the aspects investigated during the current proceeding  including the investigation regarding the product under consideration and the like product. The evidence which had been submitted within the complaint leading to the initiation of the present proceeding  including the information concerning the product under consideration and the like product was prima facie evidence  which was considered satisfying for the initiation stage  but cannot suffice for  nor predict  any final determination. (18) Furthermore  as mentioned above in recitals 7 and 8  the interim review was merely ancillary to the investigation initiated pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation and should allow to amend or repeal the anti-dumping duty in force on imports of non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan  if appropriate  on the basis of the findings of the investigation initiated pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. As mentioned above in recitals 15 and 17  the current investigation did not lead to any formal conclusions which would justify the amendment or repeal of Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 by which it was found that dumped imports of flint lighters from the People's Republic of China caused injury to the Community industry. In accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation  an anti-dumping duty shall be imposed when it was finally established that there is dumping and injury caused thereby  and that the Community interest calls for intervention. In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation  definitive anti-dumping measures can only be amended or repealed where circumstances with regard to dumping and injury have changed significantly  which could not be confirmed in the present proceeding. Consequently  the interim review should be terminated without amending or repealing the measures in force on imports of non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan. (19) Given the above  the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of disposable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China  Indonesia  Malaysia and Vietnam should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures. (20) The interim review should be terminated without amending or repealing the measures in force on imports of non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan given its ancillary nature described in recitals 7 and 8 to the investigation initiated pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At present such agreements have been concluded by Council Decision 2001/870/EC(3) with the ACP States referred to in Protocol No 3 on ACP sugar(4) attached to Annex V to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement  and with the Republic of India. (2) The agreements in the form of an exchange of letters concluded by Decision 2001/870/EC lay down that the refiners in question must pay a minimum purchase price equal to the guaranteed price for raw sugar  minus the adjustment aid fixed for the marketing year in question. This minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 2003/04 marketing year. (3) The quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with the said Article 39 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance. The balance indicates the need to import raw sugar and to open for the 2003/04 marketing year tariff quotas at the special reduced rate of duty as provided for in the above agreements so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met for part of the year. In view of the forecasts for raw cane sugar production which are now available for the 2003/04 marketing year and as a result of the presumed maximum refining needs fixed by Member State and the shortfall resulting from the forecast supply balance  provision should be made to authorise imports for each refining Member State for the period 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004.

In the absence of such request  paragraph 3 of the same Article provides that the additional duty is to be established on the basis of the representative price referred to in Article 2(2) of the said Regulation. (2) The Court of Justice of the European Communities in its judgment given on 13 December 2001 in Case C-317/99 Kloosterboer Rotterdam BV v Minister van Landbouw  Natuurbeheer en Visserij  (3) stated that paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1484/95 of 28 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of additional import duties and fixing additional import duties in the poultrymeat and egg sectors and for egg albumin  and repealing Regulation No 163/67/EEC (4)  are invalid  inasmuch as they provide that the additional duty referred to therein is  as a general rule  established on the basis of the representative price laid down in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1484/95 and that the duty is established on the basis of the cif import price of the shipment concerned only if the importer so requests.

(4) The economic interests of exporters have been prejudiced by the procedures for issuing health certificates adopted by certain Member States in implementation of the protective measures provided for by the relevant Decisions  and by certain measures taken by some third countries which have resulted in import restrictions. The situation thus created has affected export opportunities under the conditions laid down by Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1520/2000. (5) It is therefore necessary to limit these harmful effects by adopting special measures and extending certain time limits laid down in Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1520/2000 in respect of export procedures which could not be completed because of the aforementioned circumstances. In particular  the time limit provided for by Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 should be extended to enable operators who have already completed the relevant customs export formalities or placed the goods in question under customs control to benefit from the extension of the validity of certificates. (6) The benefit of these derogations should be reserved for operators who can prove  in particular on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(13)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94(14)  that they were prevented from carrying out export operations within the specified period by the aformentioned circumstances.

(2) Commission Decision 97/296/EC(5)  as last amended by Decision 2001/66/EC(6)  establishes the list of third countries from which the import of fishery products for human consumption is authorised. Part II of that list contains the third countries which are not yet covered by a specific Decision but which satisfy the requirements of Article 2(2) of Council Decision 95/408/EC(7)  as last amended by Decision 2001/4/EC(8). (3) Under Decision 95/408/EC that list is valid until 31 December 2003  therefore the date of validity of certification should be amended to bring it in line with the date of validity of the provisional lists. (4) Furthermore  since Decision 97/296/EC provides that the import of aquaculture products shall only be authorised from countries also listed in Commission Decision 2000/159/EC(9)  as last amended by Decision 2001/31/EC(10)  the model of health certificate provided by Decision 95/328/EC should be amended to include the identification of the aquaculture products  when necessary. The model of health certificate should also be amended to bring it in line with the models of health certificates usually provided for fishery products imported from third countries covered by a specific Decision. (5) However  it is necessary to provide a transitional period for the updating of the model of health certificate.

2229,Commission Decision of 24 November 2000 amending Decision 93/402/EEC concerning animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from South American countries to take account of the animal health situation in Uruguay (notified under document number C(2000) 3560) (Text with EEA relevance) (2000/755/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to the Council Directive 72/462/EEC  of 12 December 1972  on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine  ovine and caprine animals and swine  fresh meat or meat products from third countries(1)  as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(2)  in particular Articles 14 and 22 thereof  Whereas: (1) The animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from Colombia  Paraguay  Uruguay  Brazil  Chile and Argentina are laid down by Commission Decision 93/402/EEC(3)  as last amended by Decision 2000/699/EC(4). (2) Imports of fresh meat must take into account the different epidemiological situations in the countries concerned  and indeed in the different parts of their territories. (3) The responsible veterinary authorities of the concerned countries must confirm that their countries or regions have for at least 12 months been free from rinderpest  and foot-and-mouth disease  futhermore  the responsible authorities of the concerned countries must undertake to notify the Commission and the Member States within 24 hours  by fax  telex or telegram of the confirmation of the occurrence of any of the abovementioned diseases or an alteration in the vaccination policy against them. (4) On 24 October 2000 the competent authorities of Uruguay confirmed an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the department of Artigas. (5) The competent authorities of Uruguay provided satisfactory guarantees with regard to the measures taken to control the movement of animals of susceptible species within and out of the infected area  in particular by declaring the whole department of Artigas a control area for foot-and-mouth disease. (6) It is therefore necessary to redefine the territories within Uruguay from which imports into the Community of fresh meat are authorised. (7) It is justified to continue allowing imports from Uruguay of boned meat produced in conformity with the requirements laid down in Decision 93/402/EEC. (8) Decision 93/402/EEC must be amended accordingly. (9) The measures adopted in the present Decision will be reviewed in the light of the evolution of the situation.

2230,18.5.2011 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 131/14 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 477/2011 of 17 May 2011 initiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 511/2010 on imports of certain molybdenum wires originating in the People’s Republic of China by imports of certain molybdenum wires consigned from Malaysia and Switzerland  whether declared as originating in Malaysia and Switzerland or not  and making such imports subject to registration THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation) and in particular Articles 13(3)  14(3) and 14(5) thereof  After having consulted the Advisory Committee in accordance with Articles 13(3) and 14(3) of the basic Regulation  Whereas: A.   REQUEST (1) The European Commission (the Commission) has received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain molybdenum wires originating in the People’s Republic of China and to make imports of certain molybdenum wires consigned from Malaysia and Switzerland  whether declared as originating in Malaysia and Switzerland or not  subject to registration. (2) The request was lodged on 4 April 2011 by the European Association of Metals (Eurometaux) on behalf of a Union producer of certain molybdenum wires. B.   PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is molybdenum wire  containing by weight at least 99 95 % of molybdenum  of which the maximum cross-sectional dimension exceeds 1 35 mm but does not exceed 4 0 mm  originating in the People’s Republic of China  currently falling within CN code ex 8102 96 00 (the product concerned). (4) The product under investigation is the same as that defined in the previous recital  but consigned from Malaysia and Switzerland  whether originating in Malaysia and Switzerland or not  currently falling within the same CN code as the product concerned. C.   EXISTING MEASURES (5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 511/2010 (2). D.   GROUNDS (6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain molybdenum wires originating in the People’s Republic of China are being circumvented by means of the transhipment via Malaysia and Switzerland. E.   PROCEDURE In the light of the above  the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of the product under investigation  whether declared as originating in Malaysia and Switzerland or not  subject to registration  in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. (a)   Questionnaires In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send questionnaires to the known exporters/producers and to the known associations of exporters/producers in Malaysia and Switzerland  to the known exporters/producers and to the known associations of exporters/producers in the People’s Republic of China  to the known importers and to the known associations of importers in the Union and to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China  Malaysia and Switzerland. Information  as appropriate  may also be sought from the Union industry. In any event  all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith  but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation  and request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation  given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties. The authorities of the People’s Republic of China  Malaysia and Switzerland will be notified of the initiation of the investigation. (b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. (c)   Exemption of registration of imports or measures In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention. Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Union  exemptions may be granted  in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation  to producers in Malaysia and Switzerland of certain molybdenum wires that can show that they are not related (3) to any producer subject to the measures (4) and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Article 13(1) and (2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation. F.   REGISTRATION Pursuant to Article 14 (5) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that  should the investigation result in findings of circumvention  anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from Malaysia and Switzerland. G.   TIME LIMITS In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: — interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  — producers in Malaysia and Switzerland may request exemption from registration of imports or measures  — interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation. H.   NON-COOPERATION In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. I.   SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION The investigation will be concluded  according to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation  within nine months of the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union. J.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (5). K.   HEARING OFFICER It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence  they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of Directorate-General for Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services  offering  where necessary  mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this proceeding  in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file  confidentiality  extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.

(2) This Regulation should cover export refunds for skimmed milk powder and butter covered by certain product codes listed in section 9 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds (2). For the purpose of this Regulation the products in question should be in a bulk pack. In addition  it is necessary to limit the scope of footnote 13 to section 9 in relation to skimmed milk powder by setting a maximum limit for non-lactic additions to ensure that offers are made for a standard product. (3) In order to achieve an efficient administration of Community funds  to take better account of changing export possibilities for the products concerned and to increase transparency and the opportunity for operators to participate in the export scheme  refunds for those products should be fixed by a tender procedure  as was already provided for in Article 17(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 (3). (4) The destinations for which refunds may be fixed are indicated in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1523/2003 of 28 August 2003 fixing the export refund on milk and milk products (4). (5) To ensure equal treatment for all interested parties  all Commission decisions relating to the tender should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. (6) In order to reduce the administrative burden on operators and national administrations the tendering procedure should be incorporated in the export licence application procedure and the tender security should also constitute the licence security. Tenders should contain the data needed to assess them  and communications between Member States and the Commission should be provided for. In view of the sensitivity of the data concerned  tenders should not be examined in public. (7) A tendering security should ensure that the accepted quantities are exported pursuant to the licence issued under the invitation to tender. The security should accordingly be forfeited where quantities are not exported. Therefore provisions should be adopted for the lodging  the release and the forfeiting of the tendering security in addition to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products (5). (8) A maximum export refund should be fixed. However  situations may arise on the market in which economic or other aspects urge that none of the tenders received be accepted. (9) Detailed rules should be laid down to ensure that tenderers are notified of the outcome of the invitation to tender and that the necessary licences are issued for the export of the quantities allocated. (10) By way of derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6)  the rights deriving from licences should be confined to the successful tenderers to avoid speculation. (11) Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products (7)  applies to all export licences and export refunds in the dairy sector. To the extent necessary derogations from this Regulation should be provided. They should concern the refund amount applicable  the provision relating to applications lodged on Thursdays and the product code of the nomenclature for refunds indicated in licences. In addition  as licences issued in the context of the tender are for specific products  the provisions in relation to the use of a licence for another product should not be applicable. To ensure all licences have the same validity period the closing date for the submission of tenders should be taken as the commencement date.

(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2)  provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content  including  where appropriate  other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3)  to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation. (4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.

(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. (11) In view of the above  refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

2250,Commission Decision of 29 March 2001 amending Decision 2000/418/EC as regards imports from third countries (notified under document number C(2001) 830) (Text with EEA relevance) (2001/270/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries(1)  and in particular Article 22 thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Decision 2000/418/EC of 29 June 2000 regulating the use of material presenting risks as regards transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and amending Decision 94/474/EC(2)  as last amended by Decision 2001/233/EC(3)  provides for the removal and destruction of certain specified risk materials. It also imposes restrictions on the production of certain materials and of certain slaughter techniques and on certain imports. It is to be reviewed in the light of new scientific evidence. (2) The exposure of humans to the risks stemming from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been largely associated with the consumption of meat mechanically recovered from the bones of the head and vertebral column. However  for control reasons the prohibition on the use of bones of the head and vertebral column from bovine  ovine and caprine animals of all ages for the production of mechanically recovered meat should be extended to all bones of those species. This should also apply to imported products. (3) In its opinions of 6 July 2000  12 January 2001 and 8 and 9 February 2001 on the Geographic BSE Risk of the concerned third countries  the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) concluded that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle is only highly unlikely in the following countries: Australia  Argentina  Botswana  Chile  Namibia  New-Zealand  Nicaragua  Paraguay  Uruguay  and Swaziland. For all other countries for which the evaluation by the SSC has been finalised it concluded that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle is at best unlikely but not excluded. Preliminary results of similar studies carried out under the responsibility of the SSC further indicate that it may  for a very limited number of additional countries  conclude that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle is highly unlikely. All other third countries either sent no dossier or an incomplete dossier precluding a timely and conclusive evaluation. (4) Therefore it was demonstrated by the SSC risk assessment that the risk of BSE being present in native cattle is highly unlikely only in Australia  Argentina  Botswana  Chile  Namibia  New-Zealand  Nicaragua  Paraguay  Uruguay  and Swaziland. For all other countries that assessment either demonstrated a certain risk of BSE being present in native cattle  or could not be carried out in absence of complete data. Therefore only Australia  Argentina  Botswana  Chile  Namibia  New-Zealand  Nicaragua  Paraguay  Uruguay  and Swaziland should be exempt from the provisions of Decision 2000/418/EC. (5) The Commission will review the provisions for the import of products of animal origin as soon as possible in the light of additional scientific assessments  as well as the development of the recommendations of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). As before the Commission will use the information submitted in accordance with Recommendation 98/477/EC(4) of 22 July 1998 concerning information necessary to support applications for the evaluation of the epidemiological status of countries with respect to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. It therefore repeats its invitation to submit a dossier in accordance with that Recommendation for those countries that have not yet done so and will make every effort to obtain a scientific assessment within the shortest possible time of the dossier submission. (6) Considering that a new certification regime is established  a transitional arrangement should be provided for products dispatched before the entry into force of this Decision. (7) The vertebral column must be removed at the latest at the point of sale to the consumer  and thus carcasses or parts of carcasses of bovine animals that still contain vertebral column may be placed on the domestic market and traded between Member States. In order to respect the Community's obligations under international agreements  it is necessary also to authorise imports from third countries of such carcasses containing vertebral column.

(2) Taking account of the conditions for the production of certain cuts of boned beef and veal and for placing them in storage  thus making them eligible under the arrangements for the advance payment of the refund  and also of the way in which those products are exported  the control provisions laid down in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 should be supplemented with specific provisions. Those additional provisions concern  in particular  the creation of a computerised database by those operators who wish to participate in these arrangements  approved by the customs authorities responsible for control and to which the latter must have direct access. (3) A derogation should be made for some beef and veal products from the maximum period for which products may remain under a customs-warehousing or free-zone procedure provided for in Article 29(5) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. In order for these arrangements to function  in view of the special conditions prevailing in the beef and veal sector  that period should be four months.

(2) Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 states that to the extent necessary to permit exportation of economically significant quantities export refunds can be granted on the products listed at Article 1(2)(a) of that Regulation within the limits ensuing from agreements concluded in line with Article 300 of the Treaty. Article 18(4) of that Regulation provides that if the refund on the sugar incorporated in the products listed in Article 1(2)(b) is insufficient to allow exportation of these products the refund set in line with Article 17 thereof shall apply to them. (3) Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that it be ensured that trade flows that have already arisen as a result of granting of export refunds are not disturbed. For that reason the quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3). (4) Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that when refunds are set account is taken of the existing situation and outlook for prices and availability on the Community market of products processed from fruit and vegetables and for international trade prices  of marketing and transport costs and of the economic aspects of the exportation envisaged. (5) Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that when prices on the Community market are determined account is taken of the prices that are most favourable from the point of view of exportation. (6) The international trade situation or specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to differentiate the refund on a given product by destination. (7) Economically significant exports can at present be made of provisionally preserved cherries  peeled tomatoes  sugar-preserved cherries  prepared hazelnuts and certain orange juices. (8) Export refund rates and quantities should therefore be set for these products. (9) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished.

(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2). (3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community. (4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination  quantities  qualities and presentations. (6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) This derogation was granted because in a Europe without frontiers where excise rates vary widely  an immediate  total removal of excise limitations would have caused an unacceptable diversion of trade and revenue and distortion of competition in Sweden  which has traditionally applied high excise duties to the products concerned both as an important source of revenue and for health and social reasons. (3) Finland and Denmark have been authorised to apply similar restrictions until 31 December 2003. (4) Sweden has requested authorisation to continue to apply such restrictions for the same period as Finland and Denmark  as it needs more time to adjust its alcohol policy to a situation without restrictions. (5) At the same time  Sweden undertakes to raise the current quantitative limits for alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought into Swedish territory from other Member States in several steps in order for it to align gradually with the Community rules laid down in Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 92/12/EEC and to ensure a complete removal of intra-Community restrictions for these products by 31 December 2003. (6) Article 26 of Directive 92/12/EEC represents a derogation from one of the fundamental principles of the internal market  namely the right of its citizens to transport goods purchased for their own use throughout the Community without incurring liability to new duty charges  so it is necessary to limit its effects as far as possible. (7) It is therefore appropriate to provide further time for adjustment in Sweden by extending the deadline laid down in Article 26(3) of Directive 92/12/EEC for a non-renewable period until 31 December 2003 and to fix the steps of the gradual liberalisation of the restrictions prior to their complete removal at that date. (8) Having regard to the economic importance of this Directive it is necessary to invoke the ground of urgency referred to in point I(3) of the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the role of national parliaments in the European Union ,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

(2) Following detection of this harmful organism for the first time in the European Union on trees of Acer platanoides in Braunau in the Bundesland Oberösterreich  Austria implemented a programme of action in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC to control its introduction into and the spread within Austria and the territory of the Community. (3) The measures adopted by Austria were more stringent than those provided for in Decision 1999/355/EC in that they applied to imports of susceptible hardwood originating in Korea  Taiwan and the United States of America  as well as to wood from China. Further  they provided that the wood to be imported must be both stripped of its bark and free of insect bore holes greater than 3 mm across and kiln dried to below 20 % moisture content. By contrast Decision 1999/355/EC requires either that the wood be stripped of bark and free of insect bore holes  or that it be kiln dried to below 20 % moisture content. (4) The Austrian measures did not however apply to wood of Fagus silvatica and Quercus L. (5) Austria has justified these measures by the need to protect itself and the territory of the Community because Austria ""... thinks that a strengthening of the current Community measures carried out according to Decisions 1999/355/EC and 1999/516/EC on emergency measures against the dissemination of Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) as regards China (except Hong Kong) would be reasonable ..."". (6) It has not yet been possible to identify the source of contamination  although elements indicate that the import of packaging material infected by Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) is the most likely pathway  nor is there in this case sufficient evidence yet to suggest that the said Community measures are insufficient. (7) Austria should therefore adjust the measures which it has adopted with a view to protecting itself and the territory of the Community against the introduction of the said harmful organism. (8) The measures provided for in Decision 1999/355/EC and in Directive 2000/29/EC will be reviewed in the light of the FAO International Standard on ""Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade"".

2295,23.8.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 225/17 COMMISSION DECISION of 14 August 2008 on a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Seychelles with regard to preserved tuna (notified under document number C(2008) 4344) (2008/691/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007 applying the arrangements for goods originating in certain States which are part of the African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing  or leading to the establishment of  Economic Partnership Agreements (1)  and in particular Article 36(4) of Annex II thereto  Whereas: (1) On 24 April 2008 Seychelles requested  in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007  a derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex for the period of one year starting from 1 March 2008. The request covers a total annual quantity of 4 000 tonnes of canned tuna of HS Heading 1604. The request is made because catches and supply of originating raw tuna have decreased in the South West Indian Ocean. (2) According to the information provided by Seychelles the catches of raw tuna in 2007 were very low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. The indication for 2008 shows only a slight improvement over 2007 catch levels. This abnormal situation makes it impossible for Seychelles to comply with the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 during a certain period. (3) In order to ensure that Seychelles may continue its exports to the European Community  following the expiration of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (2)  a new derogation should be granted. (4) To ensure smooth transition from the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement to the ESA (Eastern and Southern Africa States)-EU Interim Economic Partnership Agreement a new derogation should be granted with retroactive effect from 1 January 2008. (5) A temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 would not cause serious injury to an established Community industry taking into account the imports concerned  provided that certain conditions relating to quantities  surveillance and duration are respected. (6) It is therefore justified to a grant temporary derogation under Article 36(1)(a) of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007. (7) Seychelles will benefit from an automatic derogation from the rules of origin for canned tuna of HS Heading 1604 pursuant to Article 42(8) of the Origin Protocol attached to the Interim Agreement establishing a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the Eastern and Southern Africa States  on the one part  and the European Community and its Member States  on the other part (ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement)  when that Agreement enters into force or is provisionally applied. (8) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 the rules of origin set out in Annex II to that Regulation and the derogations from them are to be superseded by the rules of the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement  the entry into force or provisional application of which is expected to take place in 2008. The derogation therefore should not be granted for the requested period going beyond the end of 2008 but should be granted for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2008. (9) In accordance with Article 42(8) of the Origin Protocol attached to the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement  the automatic derogation from the rules of origin is limited to an annual quota of 8 000 tonnes of canned for the countries having initialled the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement (Comoros  Mauritius  Madagascar  Seychelles and Zimbabwe). Mauritius has already lodged an official request for a temporary derogation in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 and other countries of the ESA region  notably Madagascar are expected to do the same. It would be inappropriate to grant derogations under Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 which exceed the annual quota for canned tuna granted to the ESA region under the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement. The derogation therefore should not be granted for the requested quantities  but should be granted for 3 000 tonnes of preserved tuna. (10) Accordingly a derogation should be granted to Seychelles in respect of 3 000 tonnes of preserved tuna for a period from 1 January until 31 December 2008. (11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (3) lays down rules relating to the management of tariff quotas. In order to ensure efficient management carried out in close cooperation between the authorities of Seychelles  the customs authorities of the Community and the Commission  those rules should apply mutatis mutandis to the quantities imported under the derogation granted by this Decision. (12) In order to allow more efficient monitoring of the operation of the derogation  the authorities of Seychelles should communicate regularly to the Commission details of the EUR.1 movement certificates issued.

2301,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 902/2004 of 29 April 2004 fixing the export refunds on syrups and certain other sugar products exported in the natural state THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1)  and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2)  provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content  including  where appropriate  other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation; (4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation. (6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter  taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g)  the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h)  the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period. (8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. (11) Import duties and export refunds still apply to certain sugar products traded between the Community  on the one hand  and the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia  hereafter known as the ""new Member States""  on the other  and the level of export refunds is appreciably greater than the level of import duties. In view of the accession of those countries to the Community on 1 May 2004  the appreciable gap between the level of import duties and the level of export refunds granted on the products in question may result in speculative trade movements. (12) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  levies and refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be set for all the new Member States. (13) In view of the above  refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

(2) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of Spain  cereals production will be significantly reduced in the 2005/06 marketing year. This situation has already resulted in high local prices  causing supply difficulties at competitive prices. (3) Germany has significant intervention stocks of rye  outlets for which are hard to find and which should therefore be disposed of. (4) The stocks of rye held by the German intervention agency should therefore be made available on the Spanish cereals market as they are particularly suited to the traders’ needs. (5) To take account of the situation on the Community market  provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition  provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price. (6) It is also important that the German intervention agency’s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers. (7) With a view to modernising management  the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.

Article 6(7) of the Act of Accession provides that the quantitative restrictions applied by the Community on imports of textile and clothing products are to be adjusted to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the Community. The quantitative restrictions applicable to imports of certain textile products from third countries into the enlarged Community should consequently be adjusted so as to cover imports into the two new Member States. This necessitates amendments to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries (1). (2) In order to prevent the enlargement of the Community from having restrictive effects on trade  it is appropriate  when amending the quantities  to use a methodology which takes into account  for the purpose of adjusting the new quota levels  the traditional imports into the new Member States. A formula consisting of the average of the last three years' imports into the two new Member States originating in third countries  provides an adequate measurement of those historical flows. A growth rate has been added. The years 2003 to 2005 have been selected as the most significant  as they represent the latest available information about the two new Member States' imports in textiles and clothing. (3) Accordingly  Annexes V and VII to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should be amended to list quota levels applicable from the date of the enlargement  namely 1 January 2007. (4) All provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should be adapted so as to apply to imports into the new Member States. Consequently  the initials of the new Member States should be inserted in Annex III. (5) Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should therefore be amended accordingly ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

2320,2.12.2005 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 316/1 COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1964/2005 of 29 November 2005 on the tariff rates for bananas THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular Article 133 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas (1) provides for the entry into force of a tariff only regime for imports of bananas no later than 1 January 2006. (2) On 12 July 2004  the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 with a view to modifying certain concessions for bananas. Accordingly  the Community notified the WTO on 15 July 2004 of its intention to modify concessions on item 0803 00 19 (bananas) in EC Schedule CXL. Negotiations have been conducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established by Article 133 of the Treaty and the Special Committee on Agriculture and within the framework of the negotiating directives issued by the Council. (3) The Commission has not been able to negotiate an acceptable agreement with Ecuador and Panama  having a principal supplying interest  and Colombia and Costa Rica  having a substantial supplier interest  in products of HS subheading 0803 00 19 (bananas). Pursuant to the Annex to the Decision of the WTO Ministerial Conference of 14 November 2001 on the European Communities — the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement  the Commission has also held consultations with other WTO Members. These consultations did not lead to an acceptable agreement. (4) On 31 January 2005 the Community notified the WTO of its intention to replace its concessions on item 0803 00 19 (bananas) with a bound duty of EUR 230/tonne. (5) The arbitration procedure set out in the Annex to the Decision was initiated on 30 March 2005. The Arbitrator’s Award issued on 1 August 2005 concluded that the MFN tariff rate of EUR 230/tonne proposed by the Community was not consistent with the abovementioned Annex as it would not result in at least maintaining total market access for MFN suppliers. The Commission revised the Community proposal in light of the arbitrator’s findings. In a second arbitration award  issued on 27 October 2005  the Arbitrator concluded that the revised proposal for an MFN tariff rate of EUR 187 tonne fails to rectify the matter. The Commission has therefore further modified its proposal in order to rectify the matter. (6) A tariff rate quota for bananas originating in ACP countries should also be opened in accordance with the Community commitments under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. (7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation  as well as transitional measures relating in particular to the management of the tariff rate quota for bananas originating in ACP countries  should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (2) ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2327,"Council Regulation (EC) No 1992/2000 of 18 September 2000 amending Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating in Malaysia THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  and in particular Article 11(3) thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission  after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. EXISTING MEASURES (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1001/97(2)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating in Malaysia. The rate of the duty applicable to the net  free-at-Community-frontier price  before duty  is 32 5 % except for the company Hualon Corporation (M) Sdn. Bhd. (Hualon)  for which a 16 4 % rate applies. B. REQUEST FOR A REVIEW (2) The Malaysian exporting producer  Hualon Corporation (M) Sdn. Bhd.  lodged a request for an interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to it limited to the aspects of dumping pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the ""basic Regulation""). The request alleged that changed circumstances of a lasting nature have led to a stable or slightly reduced normal value and a considerable increase of its export price so that the continued imposition of measures to it was no longer necessary to counteract dumping. Having determined  after consulting the Advisory Committee  that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of an interim review the Commission published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) and commenced an investigation. C. PROCEDURE (3) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 1998 until 30 June 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the ""investigation period""). (4) The Commission officially advised the authorities of the exporting country of the initiation of the interim review and gave all parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. (5) The Commission sent a questionnaire and received detailed information from the exporting producer concerned. (6) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the exporting producer concerned. (7) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1001/97  and were given an opportunity to comment. Their comments were taken into account and  where appropriate  the findings were modified accordingly. D. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT 1. Product under consideration (8) The product under consideration is the same as in the previous investigation  i.e. polyester textured filament yarn (hereinafter referred to as ""PTY""). PTY is directly derived from partially oriented polyester yarn  and is used in both the weaving and the knitting sectors to make polyester or polyester/cotton fabrics. The product is currently classifiable within CN code 5402 33 00. It should be noted  however  that Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 refers to CN codes 5402 33 10 and 5402 33 90 which were applicable for the product classification at the time that Regulation was published. (9) There are different types of PTY  depending on the weight (""denier"")  the number of filaments and the lustre. There are also different qualities  depending on the efficiency of the production process. However  no significant differences exist in the basic characteristics and uses of the different types and qualities of PTY. All types of PTY have been and are considered as one product for the purposes of this investigation. 2. Like product (10) As in the previous investigation  this investigation has shown that the PTY produced in Malaysia by Hualon and sold on the Malaysian market or exported to the Community has the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and the same uses  and therefore  is to be considered a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. E. DUMPING 1. Normal value (11) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned  it was first established whether Hualon's total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation  this was found to be the case since domestic sales volume of Hualon was at least 5 % of its total sales volume to the Community. (12) For each of the types sold by Hualon on its domestic market and found to be directly comparable to the ten types sold for export to the Community  it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. This was considered to be the case when  during the investigation period  the total domestic sales volume of a type represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the same type exported to the Community. (13) For those product types meeting the 5 % test  an examination was also made as to whether the domestic sales of each of these types could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade  by establishing the proportion of sales to independent customers of the type in question not made at a loss. In cases where sales of a type  not made at a loss  represented more than 80 % of the total domestic sales volume of that type  normal value was based on a weighted average price of all domestic sales made during the investigation period. In cases where the volume of sales  not made at a loss  of a type represented at least 10 %  but less than 80 % of the total domestic sales volume of that type  normal value was based on a weighted average price of the sales not made at a loss only. (14) As a result of the methodology set out above  normal value for five types of PTY exported to the Community during the investigation period could be based on the domestic selling prices of comparable types of PTY. (15) For the remaining five product types exported to the Community during the investigation period  it was found that the volume of domestic sales was lower than 5 % of the volume exported to the Community. Thus  domestic sales of the five product types were considered insufficient within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. For these types  normal value was constructed on the basis of the costs of manufacturing incurred by Hualon for the exported product type in question plus a reasonable amount for selling  general and administrative costs (""SG &  A"") and profits in accordance with Article 2(3) and (6) of the basic Regulation. The SG &  A were based on Hualon's domestic sales of the like product. The profit margin was based on the Hualon's domestic sales of the like product made in the ordinary course of trade. (16) Hualon claimed that in calculating constructed normal value the profit of profitable domestic sales of certain types which were also exported to the Community should only be used. The claim was rejected because Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation provides that profits shall be based on actual data pertaining to production and sales in the ordinary course of trade of the like product. 2. Export price (17) Since all export sales of the product under consideration were made directly to independent customers in the Community  the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the prices paid or payable. 3. Comparison (18) For the purposes of a fair comparison by type on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade  due allowance was made for differences which were claimed and demonstrated to affect price comparability. These adjustments were made in respect of transport  insurance  handling  loading and ancillary costs  credit and commissions in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. 4. Dumping margin (19) The comparison was made between the weighted average normal value per product type and the weighted average export price for the same product type  in accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation. (20) The comparison as described above showed the existence of dumping for the company concerned. Due to the varying dumping margins of the different product types  an overall weighted average dumping margin was established in accordance with Article 2(12) of the basic Regulation. The dumping margin established  expressed as a percentage of the total cif value at Community frontier level  duty unpaid  is 3 2 %. (21) The dumping margin of this investigation  however  is considerably lower in comparison with the dumping margin established for the company concerned during the previous investigation  which amounted to 16 4 %. F. LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES (22) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation  it was examined whether the changed circumstances that have led to the decrease of the dumping margin could be reasonably said to be of lasting nature. In this respect  it was found in particular that the production of PTY over the period 1996 to the investigation period has decreased considerably as raw materials were diverted to new production lines of other polyester yarns. Also  internal consumption of PTY increased significantly over the same period as it was directed to increase the production of products with higher added value. These two changes have decreased the volume of sales (domestic and export) of the product concerned significantly over the same period. These changes in the production and sales policies of the company are viewed as evidence that it is unlikely that there will be a recurrence of dumped exports at levels similar to those established in the previous investigation. G. AMENDMENT OF MEASURES (23) In view of the finding of a lower dumping margin for the company concerned and as this situation is not considered to be of a short-term nature  measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 on exports of this company should be amended by amending that Regulation accordingly. (24) This review does not affect the date on which the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) 1001/97 will expire pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

By Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 (5) and (EC) No 1976/2004 (6)  the Council extended these measures to PET film consigned from Israel and from Brazil (the extended measures) with the exception of imports produced by one Brazilian company  Terphane Ltd  and one Israeli company  Jolybar Ltd  specifically mentioned in each of those Regulations. (2) By Regulation (EC) No 101/2006 (7) the Council amended Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 in order to exempt one other Israeli company  Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Ltd  from the extended measures. (3) Following an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 (8)  imposed an anti-dumping duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India and maintained the extension of that duty to imports of the same product consigned from Brazil and from Israel  whether or not declared as originating in Brazil or Israel  with the exception of certain producers specified in Articles 2(4) of that Regulation (the anti-dumping measures in force). (4) Following an expiry review of the countervailing measures  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 (9) imposed a countervailing duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India and maintained the extension of that duty to imports of the same product consigned from Brazil and from Israel  whether or not declared as originating in Brazil or Israel  with the exception of certain producers specified in Article 1(3) of that Regulation (the countervailing measures in force). The anti-dumping measures in force and the countervailing measures in force shall hereinafter together be referred to as ‘the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force’. (5) Regulations (EC) No 1292/2007 and (EC) No 367/2006 were last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 15/2009 (10). B.   CURRENT INVESTIGATION 1.   Request for a review (6) The Commission subsequently received a request for an exemption from the extended measures pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20  23(5) and 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. The application was lodged by S.Z.P. Plastic Packaging Products Ltd (SZP)  a producer in Israel (the country concerned). 2.   Initiation of a review (7) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by SZP and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20  23(5) and 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting SZP an exemption from the extended measures. After consultation of the Advisory Committee  and after the Union industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  the Commission initiated  by Regulation (EU) No 6/2010 (11) (the initiating Regulation)  a review of Regulations (EC) No 1292/2007 and (EC) No 367/2006 with regard to SZP. (8) The Regulation initiating the review repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 with regard to imports of the product under investigation consigned from Israel by SZP. Simultaneously  pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation  customs authorities were directed to take appropriate steps to register such imports. 3.   Product concerned (9) The product concerned is the same as that defined in the regulations imposing the original measures  being polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India  currently falling within CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (the product concerned). (10) It is considered that the PET film consigned from Israel to the Union under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (the product under review) has the same basic technical  physical and chemical characteristics and the same uses as the product concerned. Therefore  it is considered to be a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 2(c) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. 4.   Investigation (11) The Commission officially advised SZP and the representatives of the country concerned of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were invited to make their views known and informed of the possibility to request a hearing. No such request was  however  received. (12) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to SZP and received a reply within the relevant deadline. The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the purposes of the review. A verification visit was carried out at the premises of SZP. 5.   Investigation period (13) The investigation covered the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 (the IP). Data was collected from 2006 up to the end of the IP to investigate any change in the pattern of trade. C.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (14) The investigation confirmed that SZP did not export the product under review to the European Union during the period of the investigation that led to the extended measures  i.e. 1 January to 31 December 2003. SZP’s first exports of the product under review occurred subsequent to the extension of measures to  inter alia  Israel. (15) Furthermore  according to documentary evidence submitted  SZP was able to satisfactorily demonstrate that it did not have any direct or indirect links with any of the Indian exporting producers or Israeli companies subject to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force. (16) As already mentioned in recital 14  SZP did not export the product concerned to the Union until after the period of investigation that led to the extended measures. SZP manufactures PET film and either sells this film or uses it itself to produce a range of packaging products. (17) Raw material of Indian origin  amongst others  is used by SZP to manufacture PET film exported to the Union but this was not considered to be a process involving circumvention. The Indian raw material constituted only a small proportion of the raw material bought at arms-length by SZP and was mixed with other raw materials which were mainly purchased domestically. The Indian producer of the raw material is a long-standing supplier to SZP. (18) In addition no evidence was found that SZP was purchasing finished PET film from India to resell or tranship to the European Union. D.   AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED (19) In accordance with the above findings that SZP has not engaged in circumvention practices  the company should be exempted from the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force. (20) The registration of imports of PET film consigned from Israel by SZP  as imposed by the initiating Regulation  should cease. In accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation  which provides that measures shall be applied against registered imports from the date of registration  and in view of the exemption of the company from measures  no anti-dumping duty should be collected on imports of PET film consigned from Israel by SZP which entered the Union under registration imposed by the initiating Regulation. (21) In relation to the countervailing measures  as SZP has been found not to be circumventing the measures in force  the exemption should take effect from the date of entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 6/2010 in accordance with Article 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. Repayment or remission must be requested from national customs authorities in accordance with applicable customs legislation. (22) The exemption from the extended measures granted to PET film produced by SZP shall  in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation  remain valid on condition that the facts as finally ascertained justify the exemption and that it is  for instance  not established that the exemption was granted on the basis of false or misleading information submitted by the company concerned. Should prima facie evidence indicate otherwise  an investigation may be initiated by the Commission to establish if withdrawal of the exemption is warranted. (23) The exemption from the extended measures of imports of PET film from SZP was established on the basis of the findings of the present review. This exemption is thus exclusively applicable to imports of PET film consigned from Israel and produced by that specific legal entity. Imported PET film produced or consigned by any company not specifically mentioned in Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 and Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 with its name and address  including entities related to those specifically mentioned  cannot benefit from the exemption and should be subject to the residual duty rate as imposed by those Regulations. E.   PROCEDURE (24) SZP and all other interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to grant an exemption to SZP from the extended measures.

(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.

(2) Upon publication of the definitive Regulation  no undertakings could be accepted by the Commission. During the investigation leading to the imposition of definitive measures several exporting producers had indicated their intention to offer a price undertaking but they had failed to submit sufficiently substantiated undertaking offers within the deadlines set in Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation. Nevertheless  as set out in recital 152 of the definitive Regulation  the Council  in view of the complexity of the issue for the economic operators in question (predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises) and given that the definitive disclosure was not preceded by a provisional disclosure  considered that they should exceptionally be allowed to complete their undertaking offers beyond the said deadline. B.   UNDERTAKING (3) Subsequent to the abovementioned deadline  the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products (CCCME) together with 20 cooperating Chinese companies or cooperating groups of companies  including the related importer of one of the groups (the companies) offered a joint undertaking. The undertaking stipulates that a breach by any of the companies or the CCCME shall be considered as a breach of the undertaking by all signatories. However  given that the resales of the related importer in the Community are not under the aegis of the CCCME  any violation by that related importer or its related exporters in the PRC shall be considered as a breach only from that particular group. The undertaking offer was supported by the Chinese authorities. (4) According to this undertaking  the CCCME and the companies undertake to ensure that the product concerned is exported at or above a minimum price set at a level that eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. In addition  the offer made foresees the indexation of the minimum price of the product concerned in accordance with public international quotations for its main raw material  i.e. pig iron  given that the casting prices vary significantly depending on the prices of pig iron. (5) In view of the foregoing  the Commission considers that the joint undertaking offered by the CCCME and the companies can be accepted since it eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. Moreover  the regular and detailed reports which the CCCME and the companies undertook to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring  and it is considered that the risk of circumvention of the undertaking is limited. (6) In order to enable the Commission to monitor effectively the compliance with the undertaking  when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) 268/2006 (3). This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty established in the above-mentioned Regulation will instead be payable. (7) To further ensure the effective respect of the undertaking  the importers have been made aware by the above Council Regulation that any violation of the undertaking may lead to the retrospective application of the anti-dumping duty for the relevant transaction. (8) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking  or in case of a withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission  the anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation shall automatically apply pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999  provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14  15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund  in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods' arrival at destination. (3) In the case of a differentiated refund  Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund  calculated using the lowest refund rate  is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community. (4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(7) provides  on an autonomous basis  for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Malta  from 1 November 2003. (5) Malta has undertaken to grant the preferential import arrangements to goods imported into their territories only if the goods concerned are accompanied by documents stating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds. (6) In the light of these arrangements  as a transitory measure pending the accession to the European Union of Malta and  in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries  it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate  where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question  not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined.

It provides for emergency measures where it is evident that food or feed imported from a third country is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health  animal health or the environment  and that such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned. (2) Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products (2) provides that the production process of animals and primary products of animal origin is to be monitored for the purpose of detecting the presence of certain residues and substances in live animals  their excrements and body fluids and in tissue  animal products  animal feed and drinking water. Article 29 of Directive 96/23/EC requires that guarantees provided by third countries must have an effect at least equivalent to those provided for in this Directive. (3) The results of the latest Community inspection visit to India have revealed shortcomings as regards the residue control system in live animals and animal products. (4) Despite guarantees provided by India  Member States report to the Commission increased findings of nitrofurans and their metabolites in crustaceans imported from India and intended for human consumption or animal feed. The presence of those substances in food is forbidden by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 (3) and they present a serious risk for human health. (5) These products of animal origin are also used in the manufacturing of feed for aquaculture animals. Nitrofurans or their metabolites are not authorised as feed additive following provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). In addition  such products of animal origin which contain nitrofurans used as antibacterial substances are excluded from feed for farmed animals  since they are category 2 animal by-products in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). (6) Therefore it is appropriate to adopt  at Community level  certain emergency measures applicable to importations of crustaceans of aquaculture origin from India in order to ensure the effective and uniform protection of human health in all Member States. (7) Accordingly  Member States should allow importations of crustaceans of aquaculture origin from India only if it can be shown that they have been subjected to an analytical test at origin to verify that the concentration of nitrofurans or their metabolites are not in excess of the decision limit of the confirmatory analytical method used  in accordance with Commission Decision 2002/657/EC (6). (8) However  it is appropriate to authorise the importation of consignments that are not accompanied by the results of the analytical tests at origin  provided that the importing Member State ensures that those are tested on arrival at the Community border and kept under the official control until the results become available. (9) This Decision should be reviewed in the light of the guarantees offered by India and on the basis of the results of the analytical tests carried out by the Member States.

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in eggs that the refund should be fixed at an amount which would permit Community participation in world trade and would also take account of the nature of these exports and their importance at the present time. (3) The present market situation in certain third countries and that regarding competition makes it necessary to fix a refund differentiated by destination for certain products in the egg sector. (4) Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (2)  stipulates that no refund is granted if the products are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the date on which the export declaration is accepted. In order to ensure uniform application of the rules in force  it should be stated that  in order to qualify for the refund  the egg products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 must bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 89/437/EEC of 20 June 1989 on hygiene and health problems affecting the production and the placing on the market of egg products (3). (5) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished. That abolition should not  however  lead to a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) The general rules governing invitations to tender for the purpose of determining export refunds for sugar established by Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 should be applied. (3) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  no export refund should be fixed for the countries of the western Balkans. (4) In line with Articles 32 and 33 of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006  export refunds may be set to cover the competitive gap between Community and third countries' exports. Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore  refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished. (5) In view of the specific nature of the operation  appropriate provisions should be laid down with regard to export licences issued in connection with the standing invitation to tender  in particular as regards the deadline for the issue of the licences  their period of validity  the amount of the security and the quantity for which the obligation to export resulting from the licence is met. However  Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (2) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 120/89 of 19 January 1989 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the export levies and charges on agricultural products (3) must continue to apply. (6) The provisions of this Regulation replace  as regards the partial invitations to tender as from August 2007  those of Commission Regulation (EC) No 958/2006 of 28 June 2006 on a standing invitation to tender to determine refunds on exports of white sugar for the 2006/2007 marketing year (4).

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice (2) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds. (3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ‘cereal products’  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ‘other cereals’  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) The current situation on the cereals market and  in particular  the supply prospects mean that the export refunds should be abolished.

BACKGROUND (1)  On 19 December 1994  the Commission  by Regulation (EC) No 3119/94  (3)   imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in Russia   Ukraine  Brazil and South Africa. (2)  On 26 July 1995  the Commission  by Decision 95/418/EC  (4)  accepted an undertaking offered  by  inter alia  the South African producer  Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited   thereby terminating the investigation with regard to this company. (3)  On 6 October 1995  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 2413/95  (5)  imposed a definitive  anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in Russia  Ukraine  Brazil and  South Africa. That Regulation excludes from the application of the duty imports of  ferro-silico-manganese produced and exported by  inter alia Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation  Limited on the basis of the undertaking accepted by the Commission. (4)  By correspondence sent to the Commission immediately prior to the adoption of Regulation (EC)  No 2413/95  however  Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited withdrew the undertaking. A  proposal is accordingly being made to the Council to amend Regulation (EC) No 2413/95 by imposing a  definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese produced and exported by this  company. II.  REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS A.  Grounds for action (5)  In light of the circumstances  described above  it is considered appropriate that  pending a decision by the Council on the  imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese produced and  exported by Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited  such imports be made subject to  registration pursuant to Article 10 (5)  in conjunction with Article 14 (5)  of Regulation (EC) No  3283/94. This will ensure that  should the Council impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on these  imports  the duty can be levied retroactively from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.  The amount of possible future liability cannot  however  be estimated at this stage of the  procedure. B.  Imports subject to registration (6)  The imports subject to registration are imports of  ferro-silico-manganese  falling within CN Code 7202  30  00  originating in South Africa  produced  and exported by Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited (Taric additional code 8874) ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) It results from regular monitoring of the information providing the basis for the verification of the import prices in the poultrymeat and egg sectors and for egg albumin that the representative prices for imports of certain products should be amended taking into account variations of prices according to origin. Therefore  representative prices should be published. (3) It is necessary to apply this amendment as soon as possible  given the situation on the market.

(2) The standard import value is calculated each working day  in accordance with Article 136(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011  taking into account variable daily data.

Where the system of advance fixing is applied  the rate of refund in force on the day on which the application for advance fixing is lodged applies to goods exported at a later date during the validity period of the refund certificate. (2) However  as the rates of refund for milk  sugar  cereals and rice are liable to be fixed or modified on Thursdays  there would be a risk of applications for advance fixing for those products being lodged for speculative reasons if such applications lodged on a Thursday were deemed to have been submitted on that day. In order to reduce that risk it should therefore be provided that where an application for advance fixing is lodged on a Thursday  the application is deemed to have been submitted on the following working day. (3) Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3) provides that no refund is to be granted on products that are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the day of acceptance of the export declaration. In order to ensure that this rule is uniformly applied it should be stipulated in Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 that for a refund to be granted on the products that are indicated in Article 1 of Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk  heat-treated milk and milk-based products(4)  or Article 1 of Council Directive 89/437/EEC of 20 June 1989 on hygiene and health problems affecting the production and the placing on the market of egg products(5)  and appear in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  they must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of those directives and carry the required health mark. (4) As some operators may  in practice  require time to make the arrangements necessary to ensure that the packaging on their goods bear the requisite health mark  this requirement should not apply before 15 April 2004.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1821/98(2)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 41 1 % on imports of certain magnetic disks (3 5"" microdisks)  used to record and store encoded digital computer information (hereinafter referred to as the ""product concerned"")  falling within CN code ex 8523 20 90 (Taric code 8523 20 90*10 ) and originating in Indonesia. B. PRESENT PROCEDURE (2) The Commission subsequently received an application from the Indonesian producer PT Betadiskindo Binatama (hereinafter referred to as ""Betadiskindo"" or ""the company"") for a review of the measures currently in force  namely a request to initiate a ""new exporter"" review of Regulation (EC) No 1821/98  pursuant to Article 11(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Basic Regulation""). Betadiskindo claimed that it was not related to any of the exporters or producers in Indonesia subject to the anti-dumping measures in force with regard to the product concerned. Furthermore  the company claimed that it had not exported the product concerned to the Community during the original period of investigation (1 March 1994 to 28 February 1995) but that it had exported the product concerned to the Community subsequently. (3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the company  and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  the Commission initiated  by Regulation (EC) No 2152/98(3)  a review of Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 with regard to Betadiskindo and commenced its investigation. The Regulation initiating the review also repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 with regard to imports of the product concerned  produced and exported to the Community by Betadiskindo  and directed customs authorities  pursuant to Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation  to take appropriate steps to register such imports. (4) The product covered by the review was the same product as the one under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1821/98. (5) The Commission officially advised Betadiskindo and the representatives of the exporting country. Furthermore  it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However  no such request was received by the Commission. On commencing the investigation  the Commission sent a questionnaire to Betadiskindo. However  the reply to the questionnaire contained deficiencies which the company was asked to rectify but failed to do so. Moreover  the Commission was unable to verify the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation because no verification visit could be arranged  despite the fact that the company had been informed of the tight time limits applicable to the investigation and of the possible consequence of non-cooperation. C. SCOPE OF REVIEW (6) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made  the review was limited to dumping. D. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (7) As the company's lack of cooperation meant that the Commission was unable to establish whether the company was indeed a newcomer or calculate the level of dumping  findings were made in accordance with Article 18(1) of the Basic Regulation. In the absence of any cooperation  it must be concluded that imports into the Community of certain magnetic disks (3 5"" microdisks) produced and exported by Betadiskindo should be subject to the country-wide duty (41 1 %) imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 and that that rate of duty should therefore be reimposed. E. RETROACTIVE LEVYING OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY (8) As the review has resulted in a determination of dumping in respect of Betadiskindo  the anti-dumping duty applicable to this company shall also be levied retroactively from the date of initiation of the review on imports which  pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2152/98  have been subject to registration. F. DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURES (9) Betadiskindo was informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to propose the application of Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 to its imports into the Community. (10) This review does not affect the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 will expire pursuant to Article 11(2) of the Basic Regulation ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.

Article 18(4) of that Regulation provides that if the refund on the sugar incorporated in the products listed in Article 1(2)(b) is insufficient to allow exportation of these products the refund set in line with Article 17 thereof shall apply to them. (3) Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that it be ensured that trade flows that have already arisen as a result of granting of export refunds are not disturbed. For that reason the quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3).

(2) In view of the difficulties that these veterinary checks have caused for importers holding licences issued during the first six months of 2002  in the case of imports originating in Lithuania  the validity period of those licences was extended to 30 September 2002 and 31 January 2003 respectively by Commission Regulations (EC) No 1333/2002(8) and (EC) No 1925/2002(9)  derogating from Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001(10)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2302/2002(11). (3) Given that these difficulties persist and  furthermore  that the veterinary checks carried out by the Lithuanian and Slovene authorities have led to the temporary suspension of certain operators from the possibility to export dairy products  the validity of the import licences issued in January and July 2002 under quota No 09.4554 in the case of Lithuania  and the import licences issued in July 2002 under quota No 09.4086 in the case of Slovenia  should be extended to 30 June 2003.

It was discovered that all available stocks of milk powder in that country were contaminated with chloramphenicol and that the exporting firms concerned were no longer able to deliver the quantities for which contracts had been concluded before the end of the period of validity of the licences. (5) The validity of the import licences issued in July 2002 under quota No 09.4549 for imports originating in Latvia should therefore be extended to 30 June 2003.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2390/2000(3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. (2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardized by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (6) Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not provide for the compensation system for storage costs to be extended after 1 July 2001. This should therefore be taken into account when fixing the amounts of refunds  in particular with regard to the advance-fixing options.

Exceptions to that rule are possible provided that conditions are laid down offering equivalent guarantees. (2) In the event that export refunds are differentiated according to destination  Article 18(1) and (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1557/2000(4)  stipulates that part of the refund  calculated using the lowest rate for the refund  is to be paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territoriy of the Community. (3) Under special arrangements with certain third countries  the refund rate applicable to the export of certain milk products to those countries may be lower  in some cases by a large amount  than the refund normally applied. It is also possible that no refund may be fixed so that no lowest rate of the refund can be fixed either. (4) Council Regulation (EC) No 2851/2000(5) establishes certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and provides for an adjustment  as an autonomous and transitional measure  of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Poland. One of those concessions results in a differentiation of refunds from 1 January 2001 for certain products falling within CN code 0405 as a result of the abolition of refunds on those products exported to Poland. (5) Article 20b of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products(6)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2884/2000(7)  provides for the obligation for operators to present to the competent authorities  on importation into Poland of certain products falling within CN code 0405  a certified copy of the export licence and the relevant export declaration. The export licence must include specific information guaranteeing that no export refund has been granted on the products in question. The Polish authorities have undertaken to ensure that Article 20b of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 is complied with. (6) Those special arrangements must therefore be taken into account when applying the above provisions of Regulations (EC) No 1255/1999 and (EC) No 800/1999 so that exporters are not burdened with unnecessary costs in their trade with third countries. To that end  when the lowest refund rate is determined  no account is to be taken of the rates fixed under the conditions and for the particular destination in question.

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 5700 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2305/2002(5)  should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

(2) At the basis of that decision were findings made in Serbia and Montenegro according to which the system of certification and control of the preferential origin of sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 did not allow the competent authorities of this beneficiary country to verify the originating status of the products and to provide administrative cooperation as required for the verification of evidence of origin. (3) The suspension measure was consequently decided in application of the provisions laid down in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000. (4) Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 states that  on conclusion of the period of suspension  the Commission shall decide either to terminate or to extend the suspension measure. (5) There has been no significant change in the situation in Serbia and Montenegro with regard to the deficiencies found in their system of certification and control of the preferential origin of sugar  despite the ongoing efforts of the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro. Moreover  a reasonable amount of time is needed for the situation to be redressed. (6) The Commission therefore considers that the suspension measure should be extended for an additional period of six months  insofar as sugar of CN codes 1701 or 1702 declared as originating in Serbia and Montenegro is concerned  in application of Article 12(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999(2)  the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wires with a diameter of 1 mm and more (""the product concerned"") falling within CN code ex 7223 00 19  originating in India. The measures took the form of ad valorem duties of between 0 and 48 8 % on individual exporters  with a residual duty of 48 8 %. B. CURRENT PROCEDURE 1. Request for review (2) Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures  the Commission received a request for the initiation of an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999  pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 (""the basic Regulation"")  from two Indian producers based in Bombay  Capico Trading Private Limited and Atlas Stainless Corporation Limited. The companies concerned claimed that they were not related to any other exporters of the product concerned in India and that they had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998). They have further stated that they began exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the investigation period  or intended to do so. 2. Initiation of an accelerated review (3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the Indian exporting producers concerned and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  the Commission initiated  by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3)  an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the companies concerned and commenced its investigation. 3. Product concerned (4) The product covered by the current review is the same product as that under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999. 4. Parties concerned (5) The Commission officially advised the companies concerned and the Government of India of the initiation of the procedure. Furthermore  it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. The Commission sent a questionnaire to the companies concerned and received a full reply within the required deadline. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation and carried out verification visits at the premises of the companies concerned. 5. Investigation period (6) The investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 January to 31 December 1999 (""the investigation period""). 6. Methodology (7) The same methodology as that used in the original investigation was applied in the current investigation. C. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (8) The Commission first examined the status of the companies under investigation in terms of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. 1. Capico Trading Private Ltd (9) On 20 July 2000  Capico Trading Private Ltd reported to the Commission that it was withdrawing its request for review. The company based this on the fact  which was verified in the investigation  that it had not exported the product concerned to the Community and that its intention to export to the Community had not been realised. The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to terminate this review in relation to Capico Trading Private Ltd. 2. Atlas Stainless Corporation (10) Atlas Stainless Corporation was established around the time of the imposition of definitive measures and registered for sales tax at around the same time. The investigation revealed that the company itself did not produce the product concerned. In fact  its involvement with this product was via a company called Venus Wire Industries Ltd  which produced small quantities on behalf of Atlas Stainless Corporation. Atlas Stainless Corporation has a ""job worker"" contract with Venus Wire Industries Ltd  whereby Venus Wire Industries Ltd processes raw material into the product concerned on behalf of Atlas Stainless Corporation for receiving a fee. This contract was agreed on 25 July 1999  i.e. three days after the imposition of definitive measures. Venus Wire Industries Ltd. itself was investigated during the original investigation and is subject to an individual countervailing duty rate of 35 4 %. (11) The agreement between Venus Wire Industries Ltd and Atlas Stainless Corporation stipulates a fixed price per kilogram of finished product for processing raw material into the product concerned. As regards payment of excise duty on goods domestically sold  Venus Wire Industries Ltd is  unlike Atlas Stainless Corporation  registered as a manufacturer and can claim an indirect tax ""Modvat"" back on its purchases of for example raw materials. There is an agreement between the two companies  whereby Venus Wire Industries Ltd claims back the Madvat on the domestically bought raw materials on behalf of Atlas Stainless Corporation. Moreover  the founder of Atlas Stainless Corporation previously worked as the President of Venus Wire Industries Ltd looking into production at the plant. (12) In addition  Atlas Stainless Corporation only exported one shipment  of around 1500 kg  to the EU during the investigation period. The shipment concerned was made solely for trial purposes for an importer in the EU  who stated that he only intended to try out the product concerned to test its quality. The importer was a previous customer of Venus Wire Industries Ltd. (13) Based on the facts verified during the investigation  it was considered that Atlas Stainless Corporation cannot be granted newcomer status since it is not an ""exporter"" in the meaning of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. While Atlas Stainless Corporation was the owner of the product exported to the EU  its one and only export transaction during the investigation period does not constitute true ""export"" in the meaning of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. In addition  Atlas Stainless Corporation made the job worker agreement with Venus Wire Industries Ltd just after the imposition of definitive measures  and the fact that this arrangement was set up at this time by the former President of Venus Wire Industries Ltd gives rise to serious doubts about the true motives of the operation; in fact  the investigation established that Atlas Stainless Corporation has no production facilities and  even more importantly  no significant commercial activities on either the domestic or any other export markets. On the basis of all the evidence  the Commission considered that Atlas Stainless Corporation has not demonstrated that it is an ""exporter"" eligible for an individual duty under Article 20 of the basic Regulation. Comments from interested parties and Commission's response (14) Having been informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to terminate this review  Atlas Stainless Corporation and the Government of India gave the following arguments: (15) Atlas Stainless Corporation argued that although it does not own a manufacturing plant  it owns the raw materials and has a job worker contract with Venus Wire  where it paid the conversion charges to job workers as per contract. For this reason  it claimed it should be considered as manufacturer of the exported product. Moreover  Atlas Stainless Corporation argued that it used the plant facilities of Venus Wire Industries Ltd for specific purposes  and that it had a normal commercial business relationship with Venus Wire Industries Ltd. (16) As explained above  the Commission does not contest that Atlas was the owner of one shipment of the product exported to the EU. However  it has concluded that the nature of Atlas' operation during the investigation period does not lend itself to a conclusion that it is a genuine producer/exporter which should have an individual duty. Additionally  countervailing measures would be rendered completely ineffective if it were possible for companies (such as Atlas Stainless Corporation)  which operate through job worker contracts  to have an individual duty  without reference to the original producer of the product  which may itself be subject to an individual duty. Atlas Stainless Corporation's relationship with Venus Wire Industries Ltd  which includes certain operational links between the companies  and the timing of the establishment of Atlas Stainless Corporation  merely strengthen this conclusion. (17) The Government of India (GOI) referred to a review request in an anti-dumping proceeding carried out by the US Department of Commerce (DOC) in favour of Atlas Stainless Corporation as regards imports of stainless steel bars. In this regard  the Commission notes that actions of investigating authorities in non-member countries have  by themselves  no bearing on this proceeding. (18) Moreover  the GOI claimed that the company had offered a price undertaking and that  in the light of Article 15 of the WTO Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994  special regard must be given to developing country members. In this respect  it is noted that the WTO Agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures does not contain a provision corresponding to Article 15 of the WTO Agreement on the implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994. In any case  no such undertaking has been offered by Atlas Stainless Corporation. (19) Therefore it is considered fitting to reject the application for newcomer status and to terminate this review without amending the measures in force ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6)  on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinized starch  no export refund is to be granted.

In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified. (2) The common commercial policy should be based on uniform principles  inter alia  as regards exports. (3) Common rules should therefore be established for exports from the Community. (4) Exports are almost completely liberalised in all the Member States. It is therefore possible to accept as a Community principle that exports to third countries are not subject to any quantitative restriction  subject to the exceptions provided for in this Regulation and without prejudice to such measures as Member States may take in conformity with the Treaty. (5) The Commission should be informed if  as a result of unusual developments on the market  a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary. (6) It is essential that examination should take place at Community level  in particular on the basis of any such information and within an advisory committee  of export terms and conditions  of export trends  of the various aspects of the economic and commercial situation  and of the measures  if any  to be taken. (7) It may become apparent from this examination that the Community should exercise surveillance over certain exports  or that interim protective measures should be introduced as a safeguard against unforeseen practices. The need for rapid and effective action makes it justifiable for the Commission to be empowered to decide upon such measures  but without prejudice to the subsequent position of the Council  whose responsibility it is to adopt a policy consistent with the interests of the Community. (8) Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Community should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations. (9) It is desirable that Member States be empowered  in certain circumstances and provided that their actions are on an interim basis only  to take protective measures individually. (10) It is desirable that while such protective measures are in operation there should be an opportunity for consultation for the purpose of examining the effects of the measures and of ascertaining whether the conditions for their application are still satisfied. (11) It is necessary to authorise Member States which are bound by international commitments setting up  in cases of actual or potential supply difficulties  a system for the allocation of oil products between contracting parties to comply with the resulting obligations vis-à-vis third countries  without prejudice to Community provisions adopted to the same end. This authorisation should apply until the adoption by the Council of appropriate measures pursuant to commitments entered into by the Community or all the Member States. (12) This Regulation should apply to all products  whether industrial or agricultural. Its operation should be complementary to that of the instruments establishing common organisation of agricultural markets  and to that of the special instruments adopted under Article 308 of the Treaty for processed agricultural products. Any overlap between the provisions of this Regulation and the provisions of these instruments  particularly the protective clauses thereof  must however be avoided ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Detailed rules of application for this tariff quota were adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1128/1999 of 28 May 1999 laying down detailed rules of application for a tariff quota for calves weighing not more than 80 kilograms originating in certain third countries (4). (2) To take into account the accession of the Czech Republic  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Poland and Slovakia  beneficiaries of this tariff quota together with Bulgaria and Romania  and the accession of Cyprus  Malta and Slovenia and pending the results of the negotiations of new tariff concessions for Bulgaria and Romania  it is appropriate to lay down in the detailed rules for the management of this tariff quota that for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 the available quantity should be staggered over the year in a suitable manner within the meaning of Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999. (3) To take into account the traditional trade patterns between the Community and Bulgaria and Romania  quantities should be fixed for three periods taking into account supplies in the reference period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2003 of live animals originating in Bulgaria and Romania. Once the ongoing negotiations on additional protocols to the respective Europe Agreements with these two countries have been finalised and ratified  new management rules will be implemented at the date of entry into force of the new concessions. (4) In order to provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application  each application of import licences should respect a minimum and a maximum number of heads. (5) With a view to preventing speculation  the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in import of a significant scale from third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management  the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 100 animals during the year 2003 given that a consignment of 100 animals may be considered to be a commercial viable consignment. Operators in the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia  should be allowed to apply on the basis of imports from countries which for them were third countries during the year 2003. (6) If such criteria are to be checked  applications must be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register. (7) In order to prevent speculation  importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2004 should be denied access to the quota and licences should not be transferable. (8) Provision should be made for quantities for which licence applications may be requested to be allocated after a period of consideration and  where appropriate  once a uniform percentage reduction has been applied. (9) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end  rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences  where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (5) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6). (10) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore  such importer should actively participate in the purchase  transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security. (11) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota  the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall not apply.

2519,26.10.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 282/13 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Νo 1254/2007 of 25 October 2007 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1)  and in particular Article 13(3) thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2)  and in particular Article 14(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

The Commission has published in the Official Journal successive lists of bicycle assemblers (4) for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation. (2) Following the publication of a list of parties under examination (5)  a period of examination has been selected. This period was defined as from 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2008. A questionnaire was sent to all parties under examination  requesting information on the assembly operations conducted during the relevant period of examination. A.   REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED 1.   Acceptable requests for exemption (3) The Commission received from the parties listed in table 1 below all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of their requests. These parties received their suspension after this date. The information provided was examined and verified  where necessary  at the premises of the parties concerned. Based on this information  the Commission found that the requests submitted by the parties listed in table 1 below are admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.

(5) For this reason  and in accordance with Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation  the parties listed in the above table should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty. (6) In accordance with Article 7(2) of the exemption Regulation  the exemption of the parties listed in table 1 from the extended anti-dumping duty should take effect as from the date of receipt of their requests. In addition  their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption. 2.   Unacceptable requests for exemption and withdrawals (7) The party listed in table 2 below also submitted requests for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty. Name Address Country TARIC additional code Eusa Mart An der Welle 4  60322 Frankfurt am Main DE A857 (8) The party did not submit a questionnaire reply. (9) Since the party listed in table 2 failed to meet the criteria for exemption set by Article 6(2) of the exemption Regulation  the Commission has to reject its requests for exemption  in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Regulation. In the light of this  the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty must be collected as from the date of receipt of the request submitted by this party. B.   REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY GRANTED 1.   Admissible requests for exemption for which suspension should be granted (10) Interested parties are hereby informed of the receipt of a further request for exemption  pursuant to Article 3 of the exemption Regulation  from a party listed in table 3. The suspension from the extended duty  following this request  should take effect as shown in the column headed ‘Date of effect’: Name Address Country Exemption pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 88/97 Date of effect TARIC additional code Winora-Staiger GmbH Max-Planck-Straße 6  97526 Sennfeld DE Article 5 27.11.2008 A894 2.   Inadmissible requests for exemption (11) The parties listed in table 4 also submitted requests for exemption from the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty: Name Address Country Cicli B Radsport Bornmann Import + Versand Königstor 48  34117 Kassel DE MSC Bikes SL C/Hostalets  Nave 3.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination. (5) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

2526,COUNCIL  REGULATION (EEC) No 1119/86 of 17 April 1986 repealing the definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  and in particular Articles 7 and 14 thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultations within the Advisory Committee provided for in that Regulation  Whereas the following is the case: A. Definitive action 1. Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 (2)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2902/85 (3)  imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain and falling within subheadings ex 73.18 B I and ex 73.18 B III of the Common Customs Tariff  corresponding to NIMEXE codes 73.18 ex 13  ex 23  ex 27  ex 28  ex 72 and ex 74. B. Review 2. In connection with the accession of Spain to the European Communities  the Spanish Government has introduced  with effect from 1 January 1986  a new turnover tax system based on value added (Impuesto sobre el Valor AĂąadido)  which replaced the former cascade turnover tax system (Impuesto sobre el TrĂĄfico de las Empresas y Recargos Provinciales). C. Repeal of definitive countervailing duty 3. It is considered that as a result of the application of the new tax mentioned in paragraph 2  the refund of the indirect taxes on export corresponds to the indirect taxes borne by the product when destined for domestic consumption and therefore does not  in accordance with Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84  constitute a subsidy. Under these circumstances  the definitive countervailing duty is no longer appropriate and  consequently  Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 should be repealed with effect from 1 January 1986. 4. Under Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1430/79 (4)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (5)  importers are entitled to a refund of countervailing duties paid on goods released for free circulation in the Community since 1 January 1986 ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1290/2003 of 18 July 2003 on a standing invitation to tender to determine levies and/or refunds on exports of white sugar for the 2003/04 marketing year(2) provides for that differentiation by excluding certain destinations. Moreover  the bi-monthly or monthly setting  as the case may be  of export refunds for white sugar  raw sugar without further processing  syrups and other sugar sector products as provided for in Articles 28 and 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 excludes those destinations. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 27(11) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the refund is to be paid upon proof that the products have been exported from the Community and  in the case of a differentiated refund  the products have reached the destination indicated on the licence or another destination for which a refund has been fixed. (4) Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3) lists the various documents that may constitute proof of the completion of customs formalities in a third country where the refund rate is differentiated according to destination. Under that Article the Commission may decide  in certain specific cases to be determined  that the proof referred to in that Article may be deemed to be furnished by a specific document or in any other way. (5) In the sugar sector export operations are normally governed by contracts defined as fob on the London futures market. As a result  purchasers accept at that fob stage all the contractual obligations  including proof of completion of customs formalities  without being the direct beneficiaries of the refund to which that proof confers the right. Obtaining that proof for all quantities exported may entail considerable administrative difficulties in certain countries  and this may substantially delay or prevent payment of the refund for all the quantities actually exported. (6) In view of the impact on the market equilibrium which those administrative difficulties may cause  alternative proofs of destination offering the necessary guarantees should be established. (7) This being a derogation  its period of application should be restricted. (8) The difficulties encountered have arisen as a result of the suspension of refunds for exports to western Balkan countries as from 8 March 2003. Under those circumstances  in order to respect the principle of non-discrimination between Community operators and to protect the principle of equal treatment  this Regulation should apply to all the situations which have arisen since 8 March 2003.

(2) Due to the BSE crisis the parties declared in the Joint Declaration on the meat sector  included in the Final Act to the Agreement (3) that  by way of an exception  an annual autonomous quota should be opened by the Community for 700 tonnes net weight dried beef subject to ad valorem duty and exempt from the specific duty until the lifting of import restrictions imposed by certain Member States on Switzerland. Commission Regulation (EC) No 2424/1999 of 15 November 1999 laying down detailed rules of application for an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2249/1999 (4) opened an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef for imports from Switzerland on a pluriannual basis for an annual volume of 700 tonnes from 1 July to 30 June of the following year. (3) At its third meeting held in Brussels on 4 December 2003 the Joint Committee on Agriculture concluded that after the adoption of Decision No 2/2003 of the Joint Veterinary Committee set up by the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products of 25 November 2003 amending Appendices 1  2  3  4  5  6 and 11 to Annex 11 to the Agreement (5)  and the subsequent lifting of the restrictive measures by the Member States on Switzerland  the concessions as provided for in the Agreement should be applied as soon as possible. However  with consideration to the change in rules of origin  it was jointly felt necessary to allow sufficient time for operators to adjust and to take appropriate steps in relation to possible stocks. Consequently  it was agreed to implement the new concessions as of 1 January 2005. (4) Detailed rules of application should  therefore  be laid down on a pluriannual basis for a tariff-free import quota of a quantity of 1 200 tonnes per annum starting on 1 January 2005 for meat of bovine animals  boneless  dried  falling under CN code ex 0210 20 90 originating in Switzerland. (5) To be eligible for the benefit of this tariff quota  the products concerned should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement. A precise definition of the eligible products should be provided. For reasons of control  imports under that quota should be subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the meat corresponds exactly to the eligible definition. It is necessary to establish a model for those certificates and lay down detailed rules for their use. (6) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end  rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences  where necessary by derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6) and from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (7).

2554,COMMISSION DECISION  of 14 August 1992  imposing protective measures in respect of certain steel pipes originating in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and imported into the Federal Republic of Germany  (Only the German and Italian texts are  authentic)  (92/433/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 520/92 of 27 February 1992  and in particular Article 6 thereof (1)  Whereas: (1) An Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Economic Community  of the one part  and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic  of the other part  was signed in Brussels on 16 December 1991. Safeguard measures may be taken under Articles 24 and 27 (3) (d) of this Interim Agreement. (2) On 29 July and 3 August 1992 respectively  Germany and Italy requested that the Commission adopt forthwith safeguard measures under the Interim Agreement in respect of imports of steel pipes falling within CN codes 7304 and 7306 originating in  Czechoslovakia. (3) In their requests the German and Italian authorities claimed that the products in question were being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause: - serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competing products  or - serious disturbances in the sector concerned or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region. (4) In support of their claim  the German authorities told the Commission that imports from Czechoslovakia of unwelded steel pipes falling within CN code 7304 totalled 37 377 tonnes during the first four months of 1992  compared with 7 226 tonnes in the  same period of 1991  an increase of 420 %. The result has been an increase in the share of German consumption held by piping from Czechoslovakia from 8 3 to 18%. During the same period  imports of welded pipes falling within CN code 7306 increased by  652 %  from 3 125 to 23 500 tonnes. Prices for these imports undercut Community market prices by 20 to 30 %. (5) The German authorities argued that the suddenness and magnitude of this increase in imports  the volumes concerned and the prices charged were seriously disturbing the German market in the products in question. German pipe manufacturers have recorded an appreciable decline in orders and a fall in output. The amount of unwelded-pipe-making capacity in use has fallen below 50 % in Germany  well below the 75 % regarded as the threshold for profitability in the  sector. A similar situation can be found in the industry producing threaded welded pipe  where business has fallen off seriously. The downward trend has led to an overall worsening in the situation of German pipe producers  who have had to introduce  short-time working  close some production lines and prepare to lay off staff. It is also reflected in the financial results of most of the firms involved  which have registered losses. The adverse impact on German producers of the increase in imports  from Czechoslovakia is compounded by the general tailing-off of economic activity. (6) The German authorities also argued that without protective measures it was highly probable that the very rapid growth of imports originating in Czechoslovakia would continue and perhaps increase even further owing to the increase in Czechoslovakia's  capacity to export to Germany. This is attributable both to the reduction in Czechoslovakia's domestic consumption and the major decline in orders from its traditional clients in other countries of Eastern Europe  and to the fact that the German  market's geographical location makes it a natural outlet for Czechoslovakia's industry. Such a trend would further aggravate the serious injury to German pipe producers. (7) In the light of the above the Commission considers that the criteria laid down in Articles 24 and 27 (d) of the Interim Agreement have been met and that it is necessary to adopt forthwith protective measures in respect of pipes falling within CN  codes 7304 and 7306 originating in Czechoslovakia in order to counter the injury caused to German pipe producers. The Commission considers that the imports in question should be limited using the level of imports in 1991 as a reference. This  quantitative limit should  however  be increased by 20 % to allow for a reasonable growth in imports. (8) The Italian authorities have also provided the Commission with information on trends in imports of the products concerned entering the Italian market from Czechoslovakia. The Commission will closely monitor trends in those imports and  in the light  of its findings  re-examine  if necessary  the situation on the Italian market ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.

(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates.

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

2562,14.10.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 272/16 COMMISSION DECISION of 10 October 2008 concerning certain interim protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in poultry in Germany (notified under document number C(2008) 6026) (Text with EEA relevance) (2008/795/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1)  and in particular Article 9(3) thereof  Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2)  and in particular Article 10(3) thereof  Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC (3)  and in particular the first paragraph of Article 18 thereof  Whereas: (1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds  including poultry. Infection with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry causes two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms  while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming. (2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds  but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low. (3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza  there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other poultry holdings and to wild birds. As a result it may spread from one Member State to another Member State and to third countries through trade in live birds or their products and by migration of wild birds. (4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (4) sets out measures for the control of both the low pathogenic and highly pathogenic forms of avian influenza. Article 16 of that Directive provides for the establishment of protection  surveillance and further restricted zones in the event of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza. (5) Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC (5) lays down additional protection measures to be applied in a Member State affected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype in order to prevent the spread of that disease  taking into account the specific epidemiology of that particular virus strain. (6) Article 4 of Decision 2006/415/EC requires that Member States immediately following a suspected or confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 establish a high risk area consisting of protection and surveillance zones (area A) and a low risk area separating area A from the disease-free parts of the affected Member State (area B). Those areas are listed in the Annex to that Decision. (7) Germany has notified the Commission of a confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 on its territory and has taken the appropriate measures as provided for in Decision 2006/415/EC  including the establishment of areas A and B. (8) The Commission has now examined those protection measures in collaboration with Germany  and is satisfied that the borders of areas A and B established by the competent authority in that Member State are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the confirmed outbreak. (9) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to intra-community trade and to avoid the adoption of unjustified barriers to trade by third countries  it is necessary to promptly establish a list of the areas A and B in Germany at Community level. (10) Accordingly  pending the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health  areas A and B in Germany  where the protection measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC are to apply  should be listed in the present Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.

(2) According to the information received by the Commission  catches of the stock referred to in the Annex to this Regulation by vessels flying the flag of or registered in the Member States referred to therein have exhausted the quota allocated for 2006.

In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products""  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ""other cereals""  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export. (5) However  in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets  allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.

(2) The current BSE incidence rate in Portugal calculated over the past 12 months per 1000000 bovine animals over 24 months of age is 236. According to the Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE))  1999 edition  a country or zone will be classified as having a high incidence of BSE if the BSE incidence rate  calculated over the past 12 months  has been greater than 100 cases per 1000000 animals within the cattle population over 24 months of age in the country or zone. (3) The OIE Animal Health Code recommends that bovine meat and meat products can only be traded from countries or zones classified as having a high incidence of BSE under certain strict conditions  such as an effective feed ban  a permanent system for the identification of cattle enabling animals to be traced back to the herd and dam of origin  the removal of specified risk materials and the slaughter and complete destruction of certain higher risk animals  such as offspring and birth cohorts of BSE cases. Thereafter bovine meat and products are only eligible for trade on the basis of either of two schemes: namely a certified herds scheme  indicating that the products have been derived from animals born  raised and having remained in herds without BSE cases for the last seven years  or a date-based scheme  indicating that the products were derived from animals born after the date of an effective feed ban. (4) Missions on BSE-related issues were carried out in Portugal by the Food and Veterinary Office from 14 to 18 June and from 25 to 29 October 1999 the conclusions of which were that Portugal has an effective feed ban and that a complete set of legislation on cattle identification and registration has been introduced. (5) Portugal put forward a first proposal for a date-based scheme to the Commission on 3 December 1999; this scheme must be examined in the light of measures taken by Portugal as regards the feed ban  the traceability of cattle  the culling of offspring and birth cohorts of BSE cases and the removal of specified risk materials; furthermore the implementation of those measures should be verified by a Community mission before the Commission can propose a partial lifting of the ban to the Standing Veterinary Committee. (6) In those circumstances  it is appropriate to maintain the prohibition on the dispatch of bovine products until the scheme proposed by Portugal can be adopted.

For the sake of clarity  Annex II to Decisions 2002/79/EC and 2002/80/EC should be replaced. (4) Decisions 2002/79/EC and 2002/80/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. (5) At the same time it is appropriate to correct certain linguistic errors in the German and Dutch versions of Decision 2002/79/EC and in the German  French and Dutch versions of 2002/80/EC ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2597,Commission Regulation (EC) No 10/2003 of 3 January 2003 fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1)  amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2)  and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination. (5) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001. (9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Considerable value added tax (VAT) losses were established in the construction and in the building-cleaning businesses  where VAT was openly invoiced but not paid to the fiscal authorities  while the recipient exercised his right to deduct. The non-compliant operators could not be identified or identification was achieved too late to recover lost VAT. The number of such cases has increased to an extent requiring legal measures. The envisaged liability of the recipient for VAT only concerns businesses which can exercise their right to deduct and does not cover private persons. It is limited to two specific branches  where the losses in terms of VAT have achieved an intolerable dimension. A similar derogation has already been granted to Austria by Decision 2002/880/EC(2). (3) VAT losses were also identified for supplies of immovable property pursuant to Article 13(B)(g) and (h)  appearing particularly vulnerable to fraud and avoidance of VAT  where the supplier has exercised the option to make the supply taxable. Immovable property is a high-value good; thus the taxable amount and the losses in terms of VAT - even on one single transaction - are particularly high. The maintaining of the option to render a supply of immovable property taxable is necessary to keep the VAT system neutral. In the specific circumstances of the supply of immovable property  the envisaged liability of the recipient for VAT appears the most appropriate solution for addressing the particularly high risk involved. It avoids a double tax responsibility of supplier and recipient  which would involve a higher economic risk for the recipient and burdensome recovery procedures for the fiscal authorities  and prevents fiscal responsibility of a third person  like a notary  resulting in higher economic charges for suppliers and recipients. In practice the derogation will only cover supplies between taxable persons and is therefore limited to specific cases. (4) The derogation does not affect the amount of value added tax due at the final consumption stage and has no impact on the Communities' own resources from VAT ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) In order to ensure compliance with the provisions relating to the quantity limits on catches of stocks subject to quotas  the Commission must fix the date by which catches made by vessels flying the flag of a Member State are deemed to have exhausted the quota allocated. (3) According to the information received by the Commission  catches of cod in the waters of ICES divisions I and IIb by vessels flying the flag of Spain or registered in Spain have exhausted the quota allocated for 2000.

(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2). (3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community. (4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination  quantities  qualities and presentations. (6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999  provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14  15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund  in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods' arrival at destination. (3) In the case of a differentiated refund  Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund  calculated using the lowest refund rate  is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community. (4) EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005 of 5 July 2005 concerning the improvement of the trade arrangements for processed agricultural products provided in Protocol 3 of the Europe Agreement (4) provides for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Romania  from 1 December 2005. (5) Romania has undertaken to grant the preferential import arrangements to goods imported into its territory only if the goods concerned are accompanied by documents stating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds. (6) In the light of those arrangements  as a transitory measure in view of the possible accession of Romania to the European Union and in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries  it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate  where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question  not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined. (7) Since the measures laid down in EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005 will apply as from 1 December 2005 this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication. (8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2610,5.3.2010 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 55/73 COMMISSION DECISION of 2 March 2010 authorising the placing on the market of products containing  consisting of  or produced from genetically modified maize MON863xMON810 (MON-ØØ863-5xMON-ØØ81Ø-6) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (notified under document C(2010) 1198) (Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2010/140/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1)  and in particular Article 7(3) and Article 19(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) On 24 June 2004  Monsanto Europe S.A.  submitted to the competent authorities of Germany an application  in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003  for the placing on the market of foods  food ingredients  and feed containing  consisting of  or produced from MON863xMON810 maize (the application). (2) The application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of MON863xMON810 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation. Therefore  in accordance with the provision of Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003  it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC. (3) On 31 March 2006  the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing  consisting of  or produced from MON863xMON810 maize as described in the application (the ‘products’) will have adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment (3). In its opinion  EFSA concluded that it was acceptable to use the data for the single events in support of the safety of the products and considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation. (4) In October 2006  upon request of the Commission  EFSA published detailed clarifications on how the comments of the competent authorities of the Member States had been taken into account in its opinion and also published further information on the different elements considered by the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of EFSA. (5) In its opinion  EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan  consisting of a general surveillance plan  submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products. (6) On 26 February 2007  in the light of a report published by the World Health Organisation listing kanamycin and neomycin as ‘critically important antibacterial agents for human medicine and for risk management strategies of non-human use’  the European Medicines Agency issued a statement highlighting the therapeutic relevance of both antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. On 13 April 2007  taking into account this statement  EFSA indicated that the therapeutic effect of the antibiotics at stake will not be compromised by the presence of the nptII gene in GM plants. This is due to the extremely low probability of gene transfer from plants to bacteria and its subsequent expression and to the fact that this antibiotic resistant gene in bacteria is already widespread in the environment. It thus confirmed its previous assessment of the safe use of the antibiotic resistance marker gene nptII in genetically modified organisms and their derived products for food and feed uses. (7) On 14 May 2008  the Commission sent a mandate to EFSA  with a request: (i) to prepare a consolidated scientific opinion taking into account the previous opinion and the statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants intended or already authorised to be placed on the market and their possible uses for import and processing and for cultivation; (ii) to indicate the possible consequences of this consolidated opinion on the previous EFSA assessments on individual GMOs containing ARM genes. The mandate brought to the attention of EFSA   inter alia  letters by the Commission from Denmark and Greenpeace. (8) On 11 June 2009  EFSA published a statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants which concludes that the previous assessment of EFSA on MON863xMON810 maize is in line with the risk assessment strategy described in the statement  and that no new evidence has become available that would prompt EFSA to change its previous opinion. (9) On 15 March 2007  following a scientific publication regarding a re-analysis of the MON 863 90-day rat study and questioning the safety of MON 863 maize  the Commission consulted EFSA on what impact this analysis study might have on its earlier opinion on MON 863 maize. On 28 June 2007  EFSA indicated that the publication does not raise new issues which are toxicologically relevant and confirmed its earlier favourable safety assessment on MON 863 maize. (10) Taking into account those considerations  authorisation should be granted for the products. (11) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4). (12) On the basis of the EFSA opinion  no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for the foods  food ingredients  and feed containing  consisting of  or produced from MON863xMON810 maize. However  in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of authorisation provided by this Decision  the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation. (13) Similarly  the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling  including post-market monitoring requirements  or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas  as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. (14) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5)  lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of or containing GMOs. (15) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity  pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c)  of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (6). (16) The uses  other than food and feed  which were authorised for the same GMO under Commission Decision 2006/47/EC (7) as well as equivalent conditions for placing on the market and monitoring are included in this Decision and are therefore regulated only by this Decision. (17) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit laid down by its Chairman. (18) At its meeting on 18 February 2008  the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal.

2613,6.1.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 3/9 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 9/2006 of 5 January 2006 fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1)  and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial. (8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

PROCEDURE 1. Measures in force (1) In September 2001  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001(2)  imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of gas-fuelled  non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China (the ""PRC"") and Taiwan. The duties took the form of a specific duty. 2. Initiation (2) On 13 June 2002  the Commission announced by a notice (Notice of Initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) the initiation of a partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports into the Community of gas-fuelled  non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the PRC and Taiwan. (3) The review was initiated on an initiative of the Commission in order to examine the appropriateness of the measures in force. The current measure  i.e. a duty in the form of a specific duty  does not cater for situations in which imported goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation. 3. Investigation (4) The Commission officially advised exporting producers  the importers and the users known to be concerned and their associations  the representatives of the exporting countries concerned and the Community producers about the initiation of the proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the Notice of Initiation. (5) A number of exporting producers in the countries concerned  as well as Community producers and Community importers/traders made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested within the time limit set above and who demonstrated that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted the opportunity to be heard. (6) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of the appropriateness of the measures in force. B. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (7) Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993(4) laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code foresees  for the determination of the customs value  an apportioning of the price actually paid or payable in situations where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation. (8) In order to avoid that an excessive amount of anti-dumping duty is levied  the specific duty should  in case of damaged goods  be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable. According to the well-established rules set out by the Community Customs Code  the customs value is reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable. (9) No interested party submitted any comments or arguments against this proposal. (10) It is therefore concluded that in the absence of any substantiated argument from interested parties  in cases where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation and  therefore  the price actually paid or payable is apportioned for the determination of the customs value  the specific duty shall be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Shortly thereafter  following a request lodged by the Community industry  the Council  by Regulation (EEC) No 1607/92 (3)  concluded that the anti-dumping measures in force had been absorbed by Chinese exporters and imposed an additional duty on imports of silicon originating in China. (3) In 1997  both expiry and interim reviews were initiated. These reviews were concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 2496/97 (4). As a result of these reviews  measures were maintained but it was considered more appropriate to change the form of the measures from a fixed duty to an ad valorem duty. The duty rate amounted to 49 % of the cif price of the imports in question. In accordance with the lesser duty rule  this rate corresponded to the injury margin. (4) Following an expiry review  the Council concluded by Regulation (EC) No 398/2004 (5) that the anti-dumping duty should be maintained. 2.   Request (5) On 6 March 2006  the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of silicon  classifiable within CN code 2804 69 00 (silicon content less than 99 99 % by weight) originating in China. The request was submitted by Euroalliages (Liaison Committee of the Ferro-Alloy Industry) (the applicant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion  namely 100 %  of the Community production of silicon. The request alleged that the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of silicon originating in China were being circumvented by means of transhipment via the Republic of Korea (Korea). (6) The request further alleged that there was insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of anti-dumping measures for such change in the pattern of trade and that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures were being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of silicon from Korea appeared to have replaced imports of silicon from China. In addition  there was sufficient evidence that these imports were made at prices below the cost of production and reasonable profit established for the Community industry in the investigation that led to the existing measures. (7) Finally  the applicants alleged that the prices of silicon consigned from Korea were dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for silicon originating in China. 3.   Initiation (8) Having determined  after consulting the Advisory Committee  that sufficient prima facie evidence existed for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation  the Commission initiated an investigation by Regulation (EC) No 607/2006 (6) (the initiating Regulation). Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation  the Commission  by the initiating Regulation  also directed the customs authorities to register imports of silicon consigned from Korea  whether declared as originating in Korea or not. 4.   Investigation (9) The Commission officially advised the authorities of China and Korea  the producers/exporters and the importers in the Community known to be concerned as well as the applicant Community industry of the initiation of the investigation. Questionnaires were sent to the producers/exporters in Korea and to the Chinese and Korean authorities. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. All parties were informed that non-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and to findings being made on the basis of the facts available. (10) No questionnaire replies were received from exporters/producers in China  nor did the Commission receive any comments from the Chinese authorities. (11) Two Korean companies offered to cooperate in the investigation. Only one of these imported silicon from China into Korea  but did not export it to the Community. The second cooperating Korean company neither produced nor imported silicon at all. 5.   Investigation Period (12) The investigation period covered the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006 (the IP). Data was collected from 2001 up to the end of the IP to investigate the alleged change in the pattern of trade. B.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION 1.   General considerations/degree of cooperation (13) As mentioned in recital 10  no producers/exporters of silicon in China cooperated in the investigation nor did any Community importer submit information relevant for the investigation. As mentioned in recital 11  only two companies in Korea cooperated but they did not export silicon to the Community during the period considered. Accordingly  findings in respect of silicon consigned from Korea to the Community had to be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. 2.   Product concerned and like product (14) The product concerned is the same as in the original investigation  i.e. silicon originating in China classifiable within CN code 2804 69 00 (silicon content less than 99 99 % by weight). It is recalled that silicon with a higher purity  that is containing by weight not less than 99 99 % of silicon  used mostly in the electronic semi-conductor industry  falls under a different CN code and is not covered by this proceeding. (15) From the information received from the two cooperating Korean companies as well as information available in the request submitted by the applicant  it was concluded that silicon exported to the Community from China and silicon consigned from Korea to the Community have the same basic physical characteristics and the same uses. Therefore  they are considered as like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. No submissions to the contrary were made during the investigation. 3.   Change in the pattern of trade between third countries and the Community (16) As stated above  the change in the pattern of the trade was alleged to stem from transhipment via Korea. (17) Due to the absence of cooperation from Korean exporting companies  the volume and value of Korean exports of the product concerned to the Community were determined on the basis of the information available  which in this case was Eurostat import statistics. (18) The change in the pattern of trade is based on data from the first table reproduced below. Large volumes of silicon started to be imported from Korea into the Community in 2002 and 2003  and continued at a high level until the IP. The significant volumes of imports consigned from Korea between  in particular  2003 and the IP  while fluctuating during this period  coincided with a substantial and continuing reduction (more than 50 %) of imports from China. Country 2002 2003 2004 2005 IP (April 2005-March 2006) China 39 705 56 226 55 939 30 346 22 358 Korea 1 070 5 540 2 340 4 380 3 658 Source: Eurostat. 4.   Circumvention process found and insufficient due cause or economic justification (19) Since no Korean company which exported silicon to the EU cooperated in the present investigation  the assessment of circumvention was based on information available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  including information provided in the complaint. The investigation did not reveal information suggesting that that silicon was produced in Korea. On the contrary  both Korean cooperating companies confirmed that no production of silicon exists in Korea. (20) It is therefore concluded that  in the absence of any other sufficient due cause or economic justification within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation  the change in the pattern of trade stemmed from the anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of silicon originating in China and must be assumed  as the complainant states  to consist in transhipment through Korea. 5.   Undermining of the remedial effects of the duty in terms of the prices and/or the quantities of the like product (21) It is evident from the data mentioned in recital 18 that a quantitative change in the pattern of Community imports of the product concerned occurred and that Chinese imports into the Community decreased significantly in 2005  while at the same time there was a surge of exports of the product concerned to the Community from Korea  a country where there is no production of silicon. It is therefore clear that the marked change in trade flows undermined the remedial effects of the measures in terms of the quantities imported into the Community market even if the imports from Korea during the IP amounted to significantly less than the reduction of imports from China between 2004 and the IP. (22) With regard to prices of silicon consigned from Korea  in the absence of cooperation  it was necessary to refer to Eurostat data. It was found that the average export prices from Korea to the Community were far below the sale prices and the costs of the Community industry as established in the investigation which led to the imposition of the current measures. Country 2002 2003 2004 2005 IP (April 2005-March 2006) China 1 063 1 000 1 026 964 1 001 Korea 1 031 912 961 1 039 1 061 Source: Eurostat. (23) It is therefore concluded that the imports of the product concerned from Korea undermine the remedial effects of the duty both in terms of quantities and prices. 6.   Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal value previously established for the like product (24) As explained in recitals 10 and 11  given the absence of cooperation and in order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the exports of the product concerned to the Community from Korea during the IP  Eurostat data at CN level were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation as the basis for establishing export prices to the EU. (25) In accordance with Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation  these export prices were compared with the normal value previously established  in this case the normal value established in the most recent expiry review. (26) In accordance with Article 2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation  a comparison of the weighted average normal value as established during the expiry review investigation and the weighted average of export prices during this investigation’s IP  expressed as a percentage of cif price at the Community frontier duty unpaid  confirmed significant dumping. C.   MEASURES (27) In view of the findings above it is found that circumvention has taken place within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation. In accordance with the first sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation  the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in China  should be extended to imports of the same product consigned from Korea  whether declared as originating in Korea or not. (28) The measures to be extended should be the ones established in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 398/2004  which are a definitive anti-dumping duty of 49 % applicable to the net  free-at-Community-frontier price  before customs duty. (29) In accordance with Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation  which provides that any extended measure should apply to imports which entered the Community under registration imposed by the initiating Regulation  duties should be collected on those registered imports of silicon consigned from Korea. D.   REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION (30) Although during this investigation no genuine producer/exporter of silicon to the Community was found to exist in Korea or made itself known to the Commission  any exporters concerned which consider lodging a request for an exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation will be required to complete a questionnaire in order to enable the Commission to determine whether an exemption may be warranted. Such exemption may be granted after the assessment of the market situation of the product concerned  production capacity and capacity utilisation  procurement and sales and the likelihood of continuation of practices for which there is insufficient due cause or economic justification and the evidence of dumping. The Commission would normally also carry out an on the spot verification visit. The request should be addressed to the Commission forthwith  with all relevant information  in particular any modification in the company’s activities linked to production and sales. (31) Where an exemption is warranted  the Commission will  after consultation of the Advisory Committee  propose the amendment of this Regulation accordingly. Subsequently  any exemption granted will be monitored to ensure compliance with the conditions set therein. E.   PROCEDURE (32) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Council intended to extend the definitive anti-dumping duty in force and were given the opportunity to comment and to be heard.

2663,COMMISSION DECISION of 3 November 1994 authorizing the granting of aid by Portugal to the coal industry in 1994 (Only the Portuguese text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (94/994/ECSC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community  Having regard to Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry (1)  and in particular Articles 2 (1) and 9 thereof  Whereas: I By letter of 5 August 1994 Portugal submitted to the Commission  in accordance with Article 8 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC  an activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry. By the same letter Portugal informed the Commission  in accordance with Article 9 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC  of the financial measures it intended to take to support the coal industry in 1994. Pursuant to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the Commission is to: - deliver an opinion as to whether the activity-reduction plan is in conformity with the general and specific objectives of the Decision  - give its decision on the following financial measures: - aid to the Carbonífera do Douro company totalling Esc 358 651 000 for 1994 to cover operating losses  - aid to the Carbonífera do Douro company of up to Esc 700 000 000 for 1994  to cover exceptional social-welfare expenditure to compensate workers who lose their jobs as a result of measures taken to restructure the Portuguese coal industry. The support measures for the coal industry proposed by Portugal meet the requirements of Article 1 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. The Commission must therefore give a decision on those measures pursuant to Article 9 (4) of the Decision as regards  their conformity with the aims and criteria set out in the Decision and their compatibility with the proper functioning of the common market. II The activity-reduction plan notified by Portugal must be examined in the light of the general objectives set out in Article 2 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and the specific criteria and objectives set out in Article 4 thereof. Coal production in Portugal is concentrated almost exclusively in the hands of the Carbonífera do Douro company  which is responsible for operations in the Pejao and San Pedro da Cova coalfields. Since the late 1980s  the company has suffered operating  losses which have been covered by State aid. The losses are due mainly to geological conditions  gradual exhaustion of resources  difficulties in disposing of the output and poor quality coal. All these factors combined affect the economic viability of  the operation. Furthermore  the main - and almost only - client  Electricidade de Portugal  will be converting the Tapada do Outeiro thermal power station to natural gas  so there will no longer be an outlet for the coal produced. On 4 October 1994  the Portuguese Council of Ministers examined Carbonífera do Douro's business strategy. The aim is gradually to reduce the output and workforce of the Germunde mine between 1990 and 1994  when final closure is planned. At the same time  the Council of Ministers approved an action plan to create new activities which would help to improve the employment situation in the Castelo de Paiva region and thereby offset the job losses resulting from the closure of the mine. The activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry notified by Portugal in its letter of 5 August 1994 confirms the strategy of Carbonífera do Douro  forwarded to the Commission of 16 April 1991 further to its request  pursuant to Decision  91/2/ECSC (2). This activity-reduction plan provides for final closure of the Germunde mine in 1995. This is a year later than the date given in the business strategy plan  owing to a corresponding delay in the conversion of the thermal power station to natural gas. As the Carbonífera do Douro company is not in a position to improve its economic viability by reducing production costs  as stipulated in Article 3 (2) of the Decision  it must reduce its activities. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Decision  if the aid  covering the company's production costs is to be considered compatible with the common market  it must  as well as satisfying the conditions laid down in Article 3 (1) of the Decision  be granted within the framework of a closure plan with a deadline  occurring before the expiry of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. Given that those conditions have been fulfilled  the activity-reduction plan notified by Portugal is compatible with the general objectives and the specific criteria and objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. III For 1994 the Carbonífera do Douro company has provided for an operating loss of Esc 358 651 000 for that part of its activities involved in the production of 140 000 tonnes of coal. The aid intended to cover operating losses must be viewed in the light of the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC  and in particular those of Article 2 (1) thereof  as part of the activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry  as notified  to the Commission. The aid is intended to help solve the social and regional problems created by the reduction in the activity of the production units  in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1) of the said Decision. In 1994 production dropped by 15 % and the workforce was reduced by 16 % by comparison with 1993. This trend corresponds to the reduction of activity provided for in the closure plan. The proposed aid will cover the difference between projected average costs and projected average revenue. It will not exceed expected operating losses and therefore complies with the conditions laid down in the first indent of Article 3 (1) of the  Decision. The Commission has checked compliance with the other conditions laid down in Article 3 (1). The matching of the level of aid to falling coal output  its transient nature and the implementation of a clearly-defined closure plan are in line with the conditions of implementation laid down in Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. Aid to cover  operating losses will facilitate the execution of the activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry. In view of the foregoing and of the information supplied by the Portuguese authorities  the aid to be granted in 1994 to the current production of the Portuguese coal industry is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the  proper functioning of the common market. IV Aid to cover exceptional social costs  totalling Esc 700 000 000  is intended to provide partial cover for the compensation to be paid to some 450 employees of the Carbonífera do Douro company who will lose their jobs before 31 December 1994 as a result  of implementation of the plan to close the company's mining operations in 1995. This aid is not connected to current production and must be regarded as covering inherited liabilities. In accordance with Article 5 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC  such aid  which is explicitly defined in the Annex to the Decision  namely the cost of  paying social welfare benefits resulting from the pensioning-off of workers before they reach statutory retirement age  other exceptional expenditure on workers who lose their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalization  and the payment of  pensions and allowances outside the statutory system to workers who lose their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalization and to workers entitled to such payments before the restructuring  may be considered compatible with the common market  provided that the amount paid does not exceed costs. V In view of the foregoing  the aid to be granted by Portugal to the coal industry in 1994 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market. Pursuant to the second indent of Article 3 (1) and to Article 9 (2) and (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC  the Commission must ensure that the aid authorized for current production is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Article 4 of the Decision.  It must therefore be informed of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that  to the extent necessary for economically significant exports  the products exported by the Community may be covered by export refunds  within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature  the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed  based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned. (4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Tomatoes  oranges  lemons  table grapes and apples of classes Extra  I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.

Similar provisions are laid down in the corresponding Regulations applicable to beef and veal  pigmeat  poultrymeat  eggs  fruit and vegetables  products processed from fruit and vegetables  wine  cereals  rice  sugar  olive oil and agricultural products exported as goods not falling within Annex I of the Treaty. (2) The year 2000 problem and in particular transition from 1999 to the year 2000 may provoke disturbance in the transmission of data from the Member States to the Commission in ways and on a scale that cannot be foreseen or dealt with in advance despite the efforts of the authorities involved. Smooth transmission of data relating to licences applied for and the quantities concerned is vital to the sound management of the agricultural markets and in particular for the adoption by the Commission of measures relating to the issuing of export licenses with advance fixing of the refund. (3) In the event of disturbance in data transmission  the periods for reflection in force for the issuing of export licences with advance fixing of the refund during which the Commission must take its decisions could prove too short and accordingly mean that the Commission would no longer be able to administer the licence arrangements properly. Those periods should therefore be extended in the case of licence applications submitted during the critical period in the transition to the year 2000  running from 27 December 1999 to 10 January 2000 inclusive. (4) Should the Commission note that the abovementioned disturbance in data transmission does not arises or ocases  it should be able to re-establish the status quo as regards the periods for reflection in force before the entry into force of this Regulation as quickly as possible. Furthermore  should the Commission re-establsih the status quo in the period between 27 December 1999 and 10 January 2000 only to discover a disturbance shortly thereafter  or should a disturbance occur after 10 January 2000  it must be able to reintroduce the extended periods for reflection referred to above. The Commission should therefore be authorised to take measures on its own to repeal or re-enact all or part of this Regulation.

2681,"Commission Decision of 6 January 2004 terminating the examination procedure concerning the Brazilian Export Financing programme ""PROEX"" as applied in the regional aircraft sector (2004/13/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules  in particular those established under the auspices of the Word Trade Organisation(1)  and in particular Article 11(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) On 27 January 1999 the German manufacturer of regional aircraft Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH (hereafter referred to as ""Dornier"")  lodged a complaint with the Commission pursuant to Articles 3 and 4 of the trade barriers Regulation. The complaint related to the Brazilian export financing programme ""Programa de Financiamentò às Exportacoes"" (PROEX)  which  for exports of aircraft  operates as an interest rate equalisation system. (2) The complainant alleged that the application of PROEX to the Brazilian aircraft industry  and in particular to the regional jet manufacturer Embraer  allowed the latter to compete unfairly with Dornier on the 30-seat jet market. In particular  that PROEX allowed purchasers of Embraer aircraft to reduce their financing costs to levels below those offered in the financial markets  which led to a significant reduction of the aircraft price. The complainant contended that PROEX constituted a prohibited export subsidy under Article 3.1(a) of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). Dornier further claimed that Embraer's abuse of the PROEX programme caused material injury to it on the Community market as well as adverse trade effects on non EC markets and most notably the US and Switzerland. (3) The Commission found that the complaint contained sufficient prima facie evidence of a trade barrier and announced the initiation of an examination procedure in a notice published on 17 April 1999 in the Official Journal(2). The Commission's main findings are summarised below. (4) PROEX acts as an interest rate equalisation system by virtue of which the Brazilian Government reimburses part of the interest rate which foreign purchasers of Embraer aircraft have to pay to finance their purchase. The reimbursement amounted to 3 8 percentage points per annum over a period of 15 years. PROEX allowed airlines to acquire aircraft at financing conditions that were far more favourable than those available on the market place  resulting in a net present value benefit in the range of 15 % of the aircraft's purchase price. As a result  Embraer was in a position to systematically undercut the price of Dornier's 30-seat jet and gain the lion's share of the Community and US 30-seat jet markets. In most fleet deals the PROEX financing terms were by far the most decisive factor for airlines to opt for the Brazilian jet. (5) Under these circumstances the Commission considered that the complainant's allegations on the existence of an obstacle to trade were well founded and that PROEX resulted in adverse trade effects and injury within the meaning of Article 2(3) and (4) of the TBR. (6) In the course of the TBR examination  a panel established  upon Canadian request by the Dispute Settlement Body (the DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (the WTO)  concluded that PROEX payments constituted prohibited export subsidies inconsistent with Article 3 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (the SCM Agreement). The conclusions and recommendations of the panel were upheld by the WTO Appellate Body and both reports were adopted by the DSB on 20 August 1999. (7) On 19 November 1999  Brazil informed the DSB of changes introduced to PROEX (PROEX II) in order to implement the DSB recommendations. However  Canada considered that PROEX II continued to provide export subsidies contrary to the SCM Agreement and initiated a compliance procedure under Article 21.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The compliance panel and the Appellate Body upheld Canada's position and found PROEX II also to constitute an illegal export subsidy. (8) On 6 December 2000  Brazil adopted a further revised version of PROEX (PROEX III) and Canada initiated a further compliance panel under Article 21.5 DSU to examine its WTO compatibility. This time  the panel report (adopted by the DSB on 23 August 2001) concluded that  unlike its previous versions  PROEX III as such was not in violation of Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement as it did not require Brazil to provide export credits in such terms and conditions that they would constitute subsidies. The panel conclusions referred only to PROEX III as a law on its face and independently of its application and it was clearly stated that it would not necessarily follow that future applications of PROEX III would be consistent with the SCM Agreement. (9) After the adoption of the Panel by the DSB the European Communities stated that it would remain vigilant to ensure that Brazil would respect its WTO obligations in its application of PROEX III to individual transactions. However  during the last two years of monitoring no further allegations have been made or evidence submitted against Brazil in that respect. (10) In the absence of any evidence concerning unfair trade practices by Brazil after the adoption of the WTO Panel report on PROEX III  the European Communities considers that no action is required and that  therefore  in accordance with Article 11(1) of the Regulation  the procedure should be terminated.

Definitive action (1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 (2)  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1027/83 (3)  imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain. B. Subsequent procedure (2) In December 1984  after the introduction and subsequent reduction of the definitive countervailing duty  the Spanish Government and exporters requested a further reduction in the rate of the definitive countervailing duty on the ground that Government Decree No 1313/1984 of 20 June 1984  published in the Spanish official gazette (BOE No 164) of 10 July 1984  which entered into force on 11 July 1984  had modified the system of export rebates. Article 4 of the Decree provided for an across-the-board reduction of 15 % in the rate of the rebate. C. Subsidy (3) The Commission obtained the necessary information from the Spanish Government and the exporters  including particulars from the exporters of deliveries to the Community of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels since 11 July 1984  and of the export rebates received  which were verified to the extent considered necessary. It emerged that as from 11 July 1984 the rebate for the products in question was cut by 15 % from 14 5 to 12 3 % (rounded off to the first decimal place). The export subsidy as found by the Commission was thereby reduced by 2 2 % from 10 to 7 8 % of the export price. D. Duty (4) Since the Spanish Government has lowered by 2 2 % the rebate on exports on the said products  a corresponding reduction with effect from 11 July 1984 should be made in the definitive countervailing duty. Under Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1430/79 (4)  importers are entitled to a refund of countervailing duties paid in excess of the amount due under the abovementioned Regulation on goods released for free circulation in the Community after 10 July 1984 ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) In March 1999  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 603/1999(2)  imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Poland  the Czech Republic and Hungary. (2) Within the framework of this proceeding  the Commission  by Decision 1999/215/EC of 16 March 1999(3)  accepted a price undertaking offered by  inter alia  the Hungarian company Tiszai Vegyi Kombinat Rt (""the company"").

B. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF AN UNDERTAKING (4) Following changes in its trading activities  the company advised the Commission that it wished to withdraw its undertaking. (5) Accordingly  by Commission Decision 2002/890/EC(4)  the undertaking by the company has been withdrawn and its name has been removed from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted  in Article 1(1) of Decision 1999/215/EC. C. DEFINITIVE DUTIES (6) The investigation which led to the undertaking offered by the company was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and injury by Regulation (EC) No 603/1999. (7) In accordance with Article 8(9) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96  the rate of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed on exports manufactured by the company must be based on the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. In this regard  and in consideration of the fact that the dumping margin established was lower than the injury margin  it is considered appropriate to set the definitive anti-dumping duty rate at a level of 26 4 % ad valorem  corresponding to the dumping margin found (see also recital 26 of Regulation (EC) No 603/1999).

(2) Following the transmission of new information and after additional checks  the Commission can now take a decision on the integrality  accuracy and veracity of the accounts submitted by the Estonian paying agency ‘PRIA’  the Dutch paying agency ‘Dienst Regelingen’ and the Portuguese paying agency ‘INGA’. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD (3) lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from  or payable to  each Member State  in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation  shall be determined by deducting advances paid during the financial year in question  i.e. 2007  from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1. Such amounts are to be deducted from  or added to  the advances against expenditure from the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken. (4) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005  50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Community budget if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding  or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts. Article 32(3) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission  together with the annual accounts  a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the application of the Member States’ reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. Annex III to the said Regulation provides the model tables 1 and 2 that have to be provided in 2008 by the Member States. On the basis of the tables completed by the Member States  the Commission should decide on the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities older than four or eight years respectively. This Decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (5) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005  Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency  recorded and recognised under national law  of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts  100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the Community budget.

Such measures are to take account of the specificities of fishing activities in the relevant areas. Furthermore  they are to be adopted in the light of the ongoing study on this topic and in the light of the assessment  by the Scientific  Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)  of the state of fisheries resources in outermost regions. (2) Following that statement  France and Portugal have adopted development plans for Guadaloupe  Martinique  French Guiana  Réunion and the Azores. An assessment of the effects of those plans on fisheries resources has been delivered by STECF during its plenary meeting of April 2007. (3) At the same time complementary information has been submitted to the Commission on proposed regularisations relating to an important number of vessels  which carried out fishing activities before 31 December 2006 and remained active in outermost regions without having been entered in the Community Fleet Register. Such regularisations are to be considered as an extension to the development plans. (4) The development plans contribute to the sustainable development of the fisheries sector in outermost regions.

(2) That complementary quantity should be calculated in accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/2007  2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements (2)  on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance of raw sugar. For the 2008/2009 marketing year  the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar so that the Community refineries’ supply needs can be met. (3) To ensure that refineries within the Community have a sufficient supply of raw sugar to fulfil their traditional supply needs  the complementary quantity should be allocated between the third countries concerned in a way to ensure full delivery. For India  it is considered appropriate to maintain an initial quantity of 10 000 tonnes. As regards the remaining supply need  a global quantity should be fixed for the ACP States  which have collectively undertaken to implement between themselves procedures for the allocation of the quantities in order to ensure the appropriate supply of the refineries.

(2) Following disclosure of definitive findings  Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic) presented to the Commission services  within the deadlines stipulated  an offer for price undertaking as well as a revised offer thereon  on its behalf and of all related companies  including the related producer of the product concerned Arabian Industrial Fibres Company (Ibn Rushd). This undertaking offer was not accepted due to the reasons set out in recital 292 of the definitive Regulation. In particular  the minimum prices originally offered by Sabic did not eliminate the injurious effect of dumping. In addition  the sales structure of this company in the Community was such that it did not allow an effective monitoring of the undertaking. (3) Subsequent meetings between Sabic’s representatives and the Commission services then resulted in substantial revisions to the undertaking offer that overcame the above problems. The revised offer not only eliminated the injurious effect of dumping but also limited to a satisfactory degree the risk of circumvention in the form of cross-compensation with other products. In addition  the company amended its channels of sale in the Community to the extent that it was considered possible for the Commission to effectively monitor the undertaking. (4) The final acceptable offer of a price undertaking was made by Sabic prior to the publication of the definitive findings  but at such a late stage in the proceeding that it was administratively impossible to include its acceptance in the definitive Regulation. (5) The Community industry was informed of this revised offer and maintained that acceptance of a price undertaking would allow such imports to continue to cause serious injury to European producers  due to the cyclical nature of polyester staple fibre pricing. (6) In this regard  it should be noted that the final offer made foresees the indexation of the minimum prices of PSF to public international quotations of its main raw materials  i.e. PTA and MEG. Consequently  the cyclical nature of PSF prices  which mainly reflects changes in the prices of its raw materials  is addressed in a way which reasonably eliminates the risk that the injurious dumping continues. (7) Finally  the undertaking offer foresees reporting also on products other than PSF sold to the same clients by Sabic related customers in the Community. Therefore  the risk of cross-compensation with other products is to a great extent eliminated. (8) Consequently  none of the arguments brought forward by the Community industry alters the Commission’s conclusion that the undertaking offered by Sabic eliminates the injurious effect of dumping and limits to a sufficient degree the risk of circumvention in the form of cross-compensation with other products. B.   UNDERTAKING (9) In view of the foregoing  the Commission considers that the undertaking offered by Sabic  which includes an indexation of the minimum prices to public quotations of its main raw materials  can be accepted since it eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. Moreover  the regular and detailed reports which the company undertook to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring  and the risk of circumvention of the undertaking is limited ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2734,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 1733/2003 of 30 September 2003 initiating an investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97 on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China by imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam  whether declared as originating in Vietnam or not  and making such imports subject to registration THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2)  (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 13(3) and Article 14(3) and (5) thereof  After having consulted the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. REQUEST (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China. (2) The request was lodged on 18 August 2003 by SX BĂźrowaren and Ringbuchtechnik Handelsgesellschaft GmbH on behalf of producers representing 100 % of the Community production of certain ring binder mechanisms. B. PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the allegation of circumvention are certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China (the product concerned) normally declared under CN code ex 8305 10 00. These ring binder mechanisms consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half-rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover. They can be opened either by pulling the half-rings or by using a small steel-made trigger mechanism fixed to the product concerned (""certain ring binder mechanisms""). (4) The product under investigation is certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam (the product under investigation)  normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned. (5) The CN codes are given for information only. C. EXISTING MEASURES (6) The measures currently in force and allegedly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97(3) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2100/2000(4). D. GROUNDS (7) The request contains sufficient evidence  that the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Vietnam of certain ring binder mechanisms. (8) The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People's Republic of China and Vietnam to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned  and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China via Vietnam. (9) Furthermore  the request contains sufficient evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of certain ring binder mechanisms from Vietnam appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. In addition  there is sufficient evidence that this increase in imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures. (10) Finally  the request contains sufficient evidence that the prices of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned. E. PROCEDURE (11) In the light of the above  the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam  whether declared as originating in Vietnam or not  subject to registration  in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. (a) Questionnaires (12) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers in Vietnam  the exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China and to the importers in the Community known to the Commission or which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures and to the authorities of the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. Information  as appropriate  may also be sought from the Community industry. (13) In any event  all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith  but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and  if necessary  request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation  given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties. (14) The authorities of the People's Republic of China and Vietnam will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request. (b) Collection of information and holding of hearings (15) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. (c) Exemption from registration of imports or measures (16) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention. (17) The alleged circumvention takes place outside the Community. Article 13 of the basic Regulation is aiming at countering circumvention practices without affecting operators which can prove that they are not involved in such practices  but it does not contain a specific provision providing for the treatment of exporters which could establish that they are not involved in circumvention practices. Therefore  it appears necessary to introduce a possibility for exporters concerned to request an exemption from the registration of imports of their exported products or from measures on these imports. Exporters wishing to obtain an exemption should apply for it and submit any requested questionnaire reply within the appropriate time limits  in order for it to be established that they are not circumventing the anti-dumping duties within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation. Importers could still benefit from exemption from registration or measures to the extent that their imports are from exporters which are granted such an exemption  and in accordance with Article 13(4). F. REGISTRATION (18) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that  should the investigation result in findings of circumvention  anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration  of such imports consigned from Vietnam. G. TIME LIMITS (19) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: - interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  - interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. (20) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation. H. NON-COOPERATION (21) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits provided in this Regulation  or significantly impedes the investigation  provisional or final findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. Resorting to the provisions of Article 18 may result in findings less favourable to the party in question than if it had cooperated ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.

(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.

In implementation of this Protocol  the EC–Switzerland Joint Committee  by its Decision No 1/2008 (3)  amended the domestic reference prices from 1 February 2008 resulting in the imposition of duties on imports into the Community of certain goods containing milk products covered by Regulation (EC) No 3448/93. (2) Consequently the reduced agricultural components and the additional duties applicable to imports into the Community of certain goods containing milk products were laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 634/2008 (4). (3) In implementation of Protocol 2 the EC–Switzerland Joint Committee  by its Decision No 2/2008 (5)  amended the domestic reference prices from 1 August 2008  with the result that the price compensation measures referred to in Article 3(3) of the Protocol are fixed at zero. Consequently  from that date  import duties will no longer be payable on imports into the Community of certain goods containing milk products covered by Regulation (EC) No 3448/1993 from Switzerland. (4) Regulation (EC) No 634/2008 should accordingly be repealed.

2760,COMMISSION  DECISION of 22 November 1985 concerning applications submitted by Nellen & Quack GmbH & Co KG  Gronau  for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of cotton yarn originating in Turkey (Only the German text is authentic) (85/515/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  and in particular Article 16 thereof  Whereas: A. Procedure 1. On 3 December 1981 the Commission  by Regulation (EEC) No 3453/81 (2)  imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty of 16 % on certain cotton yarn originating in Turkey; on 3 April 1982  by Council Regulation (EEC) No 789/82 (3)  a definitive anti-dumping duty of 12 % was imposed on the product concerned and the amounts secured by way of provisional duty from 1 January 1982 pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3453/81 were definitively collected up to the amount of the definitive duty. 2. On 30 July 1982  an arrangement was agreed upon between the Commission  on the one hand  and the Turkish Government and the Turkish Textile Exporters' Association  on the other. Under the terms of this arrangement the Turkish authorities and exporters agreed to raise the prices for exports of cotton yarn to the Community to specified levels (hereinafter called 'the arrangement prices'). The arrangement also provided for the periodic updating of these prices to take account of changes in raw cotton prices in Turkey which would have corresponding effects on prices of cotton yarn in Turkey. The initial arrangement prices were equivalent to the normal values definitively determined in Regulation (EEC) No 789/82 and  consequently  eliminated the dumping margin as finally established. Because of this arrangement it was decided that it was no longer necessary to levy an anti-dumping duty. The definitive duty was therefore cancelled by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2306/82 (4). Regulation (EEC) No 789/82  however  continued to apply for those goods which had already been introduced into the customs territory of the Community but not yet released into free circulation. 3. Between 1 April 1982 and 31 August 1983 Nellen & Quack GmbH & Co KG Gronau  an importer of cotton yarn from Turkey  submitted several applications to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany for refunds of amounts totalling . . . DM (5) which it had definitively paid in anti-dumping duties on its imports of cotton yarn from Turkey. The German authorities forwarded the applications to the Commission. 4. Following the submission by the applicant of further supporting evidence  the applications were examined by the Commission. The applicant was informed of the preliminary results of this examination and given an opportunitiy to comment on it. The comments made were taken into consideration prior to this Decision. 5. The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. None of the Member States disagreed with the opinion of the Commission. B. Arguments of the applicant 6. The applicant has based its applications on an allegation that the export prices concerned were equal to or higher than those applicable under the arrangement mentioned in paragraph 2 above. 7. The applicant also alleged that a certain number of the shipments involved in its applications were of low quality cotton yarn and that therefore lower export prices should be allowed for these shipments. 8. In addition  the applicant objected to the fact that export prices were established on the basis of the prices at which the goods were sold by the Turkish exporters to intermediate buyers in a third country and not on the basis of the prices at which the goods were imported into the Community. C. Admissibility 9. The applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation  in particular the time limits. D. Merits of the claim 10. In considering the validity of the applicant's applications  the Commission has used as normal values the arrangement prices (paragraph 2 above)  with appropriate reductions for low quality cotton yarn applicable at the time the goods concerned were released into free circulation in the Community. For goods released until 28 August 1982 the original arrangement prices were used and for goods released after that date updated arrangement prices were used. The Commission took the date on which the goods were released into free circulation in the Community as the basis for deciding which of these two values (original or updated arrangement prices) was appropriate. It is on that date that the obligation to pay the duty is incurred and the importer becomes eligible to claim a refund and  consequently  it is the price applicable on that date that has to be taken into account. 11. For the goods released into free circulation up to 28 August 1982 the Commission considered the use of the original arrangement prices as normal values appropriate as these prices were equivalent to the normal values established by the Commission during its anti-dumping investigation in Turkey and  consequently  to those definitively determined in Regulation (EEC) No 789/82. The use of updated normal values for those goods released into free circulation after 28 August 1982 is also considered appropriate as the arrangement contained a provision for the updating of the arrangement prices in accordance with significant movements in the price of raw cotton in the 'A' index on the Liverpool Exchange as published in Cotton Outlook. This index monitors the prices of raw cotton in the major growing countries including Turkey and was considered by the Commission and the Turkish authorities and exporters as an accurate reflection of movements in the prices of raw cotton in Turkey. Therefore  the original arrangement prices were increased by 7 5 % with effect for goods released into free circulation after 28 August 1982. The revised prices were further revised downwards by 5 2 % with effect from 20 October 1982. In this respect it should be noted that each revision of the arrangement prices only took place after full consultations between the Commission and the Turkish authorities and exporters to obtain agreement that a significant change had occured in the abovementioned Liverpool Index and that the arrangement prices should be revised accordingly. Therefore for this refund claim the Commission updated the normal values in accordance with the changes in the arrangement prices. 12. The Commission has rejected the applicant's claim  mentioned in paragraph 8 above  that the appropriate prices to be compared with the normal values are those at which the goods were imported into the Community. This is because Article 2 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 states that for the purpose of a fair comparison the normal value and the export price shall be on a comparable basis and should be compared at the same level of trade  preferably at the ex-factory level. In this respect the prices at which the goods in question were imported into the Community include the costs and profit of an intermediate buyer in a third country and therefore cannot be compared with the normal values mentioned in paragraph 10 above  as these normal values are fob Turkey prices and do not include costs and profits of an intermediate buyer in a third country. To achieve the comparable basis required under the abovementioned Article the Commission considers that it is necessary to use the prices charged by the Turkish exporter to the intermediate buyer in the third country. 13. In considering the merits of these applications the Commission has disregarded claims with regard to shipments which were paid for by non-guaranteed trade arrears (debts owed by the Turkish State to foreign creditors) because the applicant failed to provide any information on the effects of this method of payment on the transactions concerned. The applicant did not contest this. 14. A comparison of the normal values mentioned in paragraph 11 above with the export prices mentioned in paragraph 12 above shows that the applicant's claim is only partly justified. E. Amount of refund 15. The amount to be refunded should be equal to the amount by which the duty collected exceeded the difference between the normal values referred to in paragraph 11 above and the export prices referred to in paragraph 12 above. The total difference for the shipments in question amounts to . . . DM ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports  in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However  the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets. (3) For certain Community producers of sugar and isoglucose  exports from the Community represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Community. Exports of sugar and isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose exports so that the Community producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets. (4) For the 2008/09 marketing year it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit at 650 000 tonnes  in white sugar equivalent  for out-of-quota sugar exports and 50 000 tonnes  in dry matter  for out-of-quota isoglucose would correspond to the market demand. (5) Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favorable competitive position. Furthermore  in order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or reintroduction into the Community of out-of-quota sugar or isoglucose certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations. (6) In view of the estimated lower risks for eventual frauds regarding isoglucose due to the nature of the product  those countries of the Western Balkans whose authorities have to issue an export certificate for the confirmation of the origin of the sugar or isoglucose products to be exported to the Community  should be exempted from this exclusion.

The Argentinean authorities immediately informed the Commission Services about these measures. (5) In view of the potential risk of disease in this border area  and taking account of the immediate action taken by the competent veterinary authorities of Argentina  it is sufficient to suspend the importation of de-boned and matured bovine meat coming only from the departments of Ramon Lista and Rivadavia and for a limited period of time.

(2) Following the adoption of the provisional anti-dumping measures  the Commission continued the investigation of dumping  injury and Community interest. The definitive findings and conclusions of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000(4) imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil  the Czech Republic  Japan  the People's Republic of China  the Republic of Korea and Thailand. (3) The investigation confirmed the provisional findings of injurious dumping relating to imports originating in Brazil  the Czech Republic  Japan  the People's Republic of China  the Republic of Korea and Thailand. B UNDERTAKINGS (4) Following the adoption of provisional anti-dumping measures  the only cooperating exporting producer in the Republic of Korea and one of the cooperating exporting producers in Thailand  offered acceptable price undertakings (within the meaning of Article 8(1) of the Basic Regulation). (5) According to those undertakings  the exporting producers in question have offered to sell to their unrelated customers at minimum prices. (6) The Commission considers that the undertakings offered by the exporting producers concerned can be accepted since they eliminate the injurious effect of the dumping by means of minimum prices established for each product type and an ad valorem duty for the types which were not exported to the Community during the investigation period. Moreover  the regular and detailed reports of their sales which the companies have undertaken to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring. Furthermore  the sales structure of these exporting producers is such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumvention of the agreed undertakings is limited. (7) In order to ensure observance of the undertakings and their effective monitoring  when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertakings is presented  exemption from duty is conditional upon presentation to the relevant Member States' customs' sevices of valid ""undertaking invoice"" issued by the exporting producers from whom the undertaking is accepted and containing the information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) 1784/2000. Where no such invoice is presented or when it does not correspondent to the product presented to the customs' services  the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall be payable in order to avoid circumvention of the undertakings. (8) In the event of a breach  or withdrawal of the undertakings  or if there are reasons to believe that the undertakings have been breached  a provisional or definitive anti-dumping duty may be imposed pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation. C TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (9) As regards Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  the volumes of imports originating in those countries were considered negligible in accordance with Articles 9(3) and 5(7) of the basic Regulation.

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 950 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001(5)  should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

(2) The requirements in the legislation of Mayotte on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC. (3) In particular  the ""Direction des Services Vétérinaires (DSV) of the Direction de l'Agriculture et de la Forêt (DAF)"" belonging to the ""Ministère français de l'agriculture et de la pêche""  is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the legislation in force. (4) The DSV has provided official assurances regarding compliance with the standards for health controls and monitoring of fishery products as set out in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/493/EEC and regarding the fulfilment of hygienic requirements equivalent to those laid down by that Directive. (5) It is appropriate to lay down detailed provisions concerning fishery products imported into the Community from Mayotte  in accordance with Directive 91/493/EEC. (6) It is also necessary to draw up a list of approved establishments  factory vessels  or cold stores  and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 92/48/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the minimum hygiene rules applicable to fishery products caught on board of certain vessels in accordance with Article 3(1)(a)(I) of Directive 91/493/EEC(3). These lists should be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the DSV to the Commission. (7) However  the Community inspection team was not able to verify the inspection capacity of the DSV as regards the freezer or factory vessels because at the time of the inspection the two proposed freezer vessels were registered under French flag and no factory vessel was proposed to be authorised. Therefore  the inclusion of new vessels in the list will require a new inspection visit on the spot by the Commission experts.

2816,Commission Regulation (EC) No 2103/2002 of 28 November 2002 approving operations to check conformity to the marketing standards applicable to fresh fruit and vegetables carried out in South Africa prior to import into the European Community THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2)  and in particular Article 10 thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 of 12 June 2001 on checks on conformity to the marketing standards applicable to fresh fruit and vegetables(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2590/2001(4)  lays down the requirements for approval of conformity checks performed prior to import into the Community by third countries which so request. (2) On 11 March 2002 the South African authorities sent the Commission a request for approval of checking operations performed by the Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB) under the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. This states that the establishment in question has the necessary staff  equipment and facilities to carry out checks  that it uses methods equivalent to those referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 and that the fresh fruit and vegetables exported from South Africa to the Community must meet standards equivalent to the Community marketing standards. (3) The information sent by the Member States and in the possession of the Commission shows that  between 1997 and 2002  imports of fresh fruit and vegetables from South Africa presented a relatively low incidence of non-conformity with the marketing standards. (4) Representatives of the South African inspection services are regular participants in international efforts to agree marketing standards for fruit and vegetables in the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). South Africa is also taking part in the Scheme for the Application of International Standards for Fruit and Vegetables under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Lastly  for a number of years the South African inspection services have taken part in various conferences and training activities organised by several Member States. (5) The conformity checks performed by South Africa should therefore be approved with effect from the date on which the administrative cooperation referred to in Article 7(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 is established.

2817,27.2.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 56/68 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2015/315 of 25 February 2015 concerning certain protective measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in Germany (notified under document C(2015) 1004) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1)  and in particular Article 9(4) thereof  Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2)  and in particular Article 10(4) thereof  Whereas: (1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds  including poultry. Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms  while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming. (2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds  but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low. (3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza  there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products. (4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC (3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. (5) Germany notified the Commission of two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in non-commercial holdings in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania where poultry are kept and it immediately took the measures required pursuant to Directive 2005/94/EC  including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones  which should be defined in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision. (6) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with Germany  and it is satisfied that the borders of the protection and surveillance zones  established by the competent authority in that Member State  are at a sufficient distance to the actual holdings where the outbreaks were confirmed. (7) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries  it is necessary to rapidly describe the protection and surveillance zones established in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Germany at Union level. (8) Accordingly  the protection and surveillance zones in Germany  where the animal health control measures as laid down in Directive 2005/94/EC are applied  should be defined in this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.

It lays down in particular that Articles 1 and 3 of  and the Annex to  Council Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 of 28 June 1984 authorising the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 337/79(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2839/98(6)  should remain in force until 31 January 2001. However  Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 stipulates that these provisions would remain in force until 31 December 2003. Under Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999  the Commission presented a proposal for a Council regulation authorising until 31 December 2003 the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999  which applies similar provisions on the same terms as those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84. However  it seems likely that the Council will not be able to adopt this proposal before 31 January 2001. To enable the Council to adopt this proposal without interrupting the status quo where the products referred to in Articles 1 and 3 of  and the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 are concerned  these provisions should be maintained until the Council takes a decision  or until 31 December 2003 at the latest. This Regulation must apply from 1 February 2001 for the same reason. (2) The extra transitional period does not affect the implementation of the bulk of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine on the date set by the Council  since the main points concerning the areas covered by those Regulations have been settled in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or in the implementing regulations already adopted.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (3) The second subparagraph of Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.

2839,Council Decision of 7 May 2002 on the extension of the advantages conferred on the Joint Undertaking Hochtemperatur-Kernkraftwerk GmbH (HKG) (2002/356/Euratom) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community  and in particular Article 48 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas: (1) By Decision 74/295/Euratom(1)  the Council established Hochtemperatur-Kernkraftwerk GmbH (HKG) as a joint undertaking  within the meaning of the Treaty  for a period of 25 years as from 1 January 1974. (2) By Decision 2002/355/Euratom(2) the Council extended the Joint Undertaking status granted to HKG for eleven years with effect from 1 January 1999. (3) By its Decision 74/296/Euratom(3) and that of 16 November 1992 the Council conferred on HKG a number of advantages listed in Annex III to the Treaty  for a period of 25 years as from 1 January 1974. (4) By letters of 25 November 1998  15 March 1999 and 13 June 2000  HKG requested extension of its tax advantages for the new period for which it had been granted Joint Undertaking status. (5) HKG's current objective is to implement a programme for decommissioning the nuclear power station up to the safe enclosure stage and  thereafter  to carry out a programme of surveillance of the enclosed nuclear installations. (6) There is no equivalent to these programmes in the Community since  to date  no high-temperature reactor has been shut down definitively in the Community. (7) Implementation of these programmes is therefore important since they provide useful experience for the development of the nuclear industry in the Community  notably as regards the decommissioning of nuclear installations. (8) HKG should be assisted with implementing the programme for decommissioning the nuclear power station up to the safe enclosure stage and the programme of surveillance of the enclosed nuclear installations  by lightening the financial burden. (9) Arrangements for financing HKG's activities have been agreed between the Federal Government  the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia  HKG and its members for the period up to 31 December 2009.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1052/2002(4)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.

(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (6) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

2855,COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 958/93 of 5 April 1993 establishing a Community procedure for administering quantitative import restrictions and monitoring of textile and clothing products originating in certain third countries THE COUNCIL OF  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  and in particular Article 113 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas the Community has negotiated agreements with a number of supplier countries on trade in textile products on the basis of the Protocol for the extension of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement; whereas a number of other protocols  arrangements or specific  import regimes are also applied with some third countries in the context of association agreements and other types of preferential arrangements; Whereas these agreements  protocols and arrangements provide  inter alia  that the supplier countries' exports into the Community of certain textile products falling within Section XI of the combined nomenclature shall be subject to quantitative limits  fixed at Community level or to a monitoring procedure; Whereas a basic characteristic of these agreements  protocols and arrangements is the establishment of a double-checking system in order to ensure compliance with the quantitative limits established thereunder; Whereas Article 8a of the Treaty provides for the creation of an internal market  comprising an area without internal frontiers in which the free circulation of goods is ensured; whereas for this reason and also to take account of the principles laid  down by the Court of Justice of the European Communities the above agreements  protocols and arrangements do not provide any more for the breakdown of the Community quantitative limits into national sub-quotas; Whereas in order to apply Community quantitative limits and monitoring procedures in conformity with the agreements  protocols and arrangements negotiated with the supplier countries it is necessary to establish a special management procedure; Whereas it is desirable that such a common management system be decentralized as far as possible by allowing import authorizations to be issued  as in the past  by the Member States' authorities in accordance with the double-checking system established  in those agreements  protocols and arrangements; Whereas  however  it is necessary  in the absence of the breakdown of the Community quantitative limits into national sub-quotas  to make sure that the competent authorities of the Member States  when issuing the import licences  do not exceed the  quantitative limits establishing in the agreements  protocols or arrangements; Whereas for this purpose the competent authorities of the Member States should not issue import licences before obtaining the prior confirmation of the Commission that there are still amounts available of the total Community quantitative limit for which  an application is submitted by an importer to the said competent authorities; Whereas the Commission should provide its confirmation to the requests notified by Member States  and shall allocate to the extent possible  the full amount notified; Whereas requests notified by the competent authorities to the Commission shall be considered to be valid if they establish the supplier third country  the category of textile products concerned  the amount to be imported  the number of the export  licence and the Member State of intended customs clearance; Whereas pending the establishing and smooth operation of the central computerized system it is necessary to provide  for a limited period of time  that Member States shall not issue import licences over a certain initial maximum amount of the total  Community import limit; whereas this maximum amount should be fixed in terms of certain percentages of the Community quota uniform for each product category and for each third country concerned; Whereas for the effective management of the Community quantitative limits and to establish the total amount of imports subject to a monitoring procedure during this transitional period  the competent authorities of the Member States should submit at  regular intervals statistical information of the licences issued; Whereas it should be possible during this transitional period to allow for certain adjustments to be made to the maximum amounts provided for each Member State  so as to take account of the number of import applications submitted in the Member States as  well as the level of utilization of each quantitative limit concerned; Whereas it is necessary to provide that a committee will assist the Commission for the purposes of implementation of this Regulation ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

However  that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff. (2) Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 lays down that  for the purposes of calculating the import duty referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  representative cif import prices are to be established on a regular basis for the products in question. (3) Under Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96  the price to be used for the calculation of the import duty on products of CN codes 1001 10 00  1001 90 91  ex 1001 90 99 (high quality common wheat)  1002 00  1005 10 90  1005 90 00 and 1007 00 90 is the daily cif representative import price determined as specified in Article 4 of that Regulation.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white sugar and raw sugar  non-denatured and exported without further processing  are being fixed  account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar  and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3).

(4) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (8) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the re-importation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals (2).

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6)  on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinized starch  no export refund is to be granted.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white sugar and raw sugar  non-denatured and exported without further processing  are being fixed  account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar  and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3).

(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (8) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the re-importation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial. (8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(4)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. (2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 17197 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 409/2001(5) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

2913,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1693/2002 of 25 September 2002 initiating an investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000 on imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil by imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings consigned from Argentina  and making such imports subject to registration THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2238/2000(2)  and in particular Article 13(3) and Article 14(5) thereof  After having consulted the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. REQUEST (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation) to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of threaded malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil. (2) The request has been lodged on 12 August 2002 by the Defence Committee of Malleable Cast Iron pipe Fittings Industry of the European Union on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the Community production of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings. B. PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the allegation of circumvention is threaded malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings  currently classifiable within CN code ex 7307 19 10. This code is given for information only. C. EXISTING MEASURES (4) The measures currently in force and allegedly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000(3). D. GROUNDS (5) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence  that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Argentina of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings. (6) The evidence submitted is as follows: (a) the request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from Brazil and Argentina to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned and for which there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil via Argentina; (b) furthermore  the request contains sufficient evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in Brazil are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings consigned from Argentina appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned from Brazil. In addition  there is sufficient evidence that this increase in imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures; (c) finally  the request contains sufficient evidence that the prices of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings are dumped in relation to the normal values previously established for the certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil. E. PROCEDURE (7) In the light of the above  the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports consigned from Argentina  whether declared as originating in Argentina or not  of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings subject to registration  in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. (i) Questionnaires (8) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Argentina  to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Brazil and to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that lead to the existing measures  and to the authorities of Brazil and Argentina. Information  as appropriate  may also be sought from the Community industry. (9) In any event  all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith  but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and if not  to request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation  given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties. (10) The authorities of Brazil and Argentina will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request. (ii) Collection of information and holding of hearings (11) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. (iii) Exemption of registration of imports or measures (12) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product concerned may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention. (13) Given that the alleged circumvention takes place outside the Community  exemption of imports from registration or measures would depend entirely on the findings in respect of the exporters in Argentina. Therefore exporters wishing to obtain an exemption of registration of imports or measures should apply for the exemption and submit the questionnaire reply (in order to establish that they are not circumventing the anti-dumping duties within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation) within the time limits set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation. Although no exemption could be granted purely on the basis of information from importers  these could still benefit from exemption from registration or measures to the extent that their imports are from exporters which are granted such an exemption. F. REGISTRATION (14) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation  imports of the product concerned should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that  should the investigation result in findings of circumvention  anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this investigation on certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings consigned from Argentina. G. TIME LIMITS (15) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: - interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views known in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation  - interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. H. NON-COOPERATION (16) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  provisional or final findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2917,Commission Regulation (EC) No 888/2004 of 29 April 2004 fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1)  and in particular Article 31(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation  exported in the natural state  are being fixed  account must be taken of: - the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade  - marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community  as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination  - the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market  - the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty  and - the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market  and - the economic aspect of the proposed exports. (3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation  and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of: (a) prices ruling on third-country markets; (b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third-country imports; (c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries  account being taken  where appropriate  of subsidies granted by those countries; and (d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices. (4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination. (5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may  however  remain at the same level for more than four weeks. (6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(2)  the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(3)  however  this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community. (7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(4) laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products. (8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account. (9) With a view to enlargement on 1 May 2004 and to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the new Member States on the Community level  all remaining refunds for exports to the new Member States should be abolished. (10) The consolidation of the maximum quantities for export within the limits set in the WTO Agreement will be more binding on the accession of the new Member States. In order to ensure the satisfactory management and optimum use of the maximum quantities for export  steps should therefore be taken to reduce or abolish the refunds for certain destinations  in particular those located in or close to the geographical area of the Community where the level of prices for milk products no longer justify the present level of refund rates  despite the collection of import duty in some of those countries. (11) The policy of some non-member countries is to prevent disturbance on the internal market by applying frontier measures. The refunds for certain milk products exported to those destinations should be differentiated in order to reduce the risk of such measures being applied. (12) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Exceptions to that rule are possible provided that conditions are laid down offering equivalent guarantees. (2) In the event that export refunds are differentiated according to destination  Article 18(1) and (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1253/2002(4)  stipulates that part of the refund  calculated using the lowest rate for the refund  is to be paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community. (3) Under special arrangements with certain third countries  the refund rate applicable to the export of certain milk products to those countries may be lower  in some cases by a large amount  than the refund normally applied. It is also possible that a refund may not be fixed so the lowest rate of the refund is also the result of the lack of fixing of a refund. (4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1151/2002 of 27 June 2002 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment  as an autonomous and transitional measure  of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Estonia(5) establishes concessions in the form of reciprocal tariff quotas involving the abolition of Community refunds on certain milk products. Similar concessions have been agreed with Latvia and Lithuania. Refunds for the products concerned from the three Baltic states have therefore been abolished with effect from 4 July 2002. (5) The abolition of refunds entails a differentiation of refunds for certain milk products. So as to avoid requiring exporters to furnish proof of arrival at destination in order to qualify for a refund in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999  the authorities of the countries to whom concessions have been granted have undertaken to ensure that only consignments of Community products which have not received refunds will be accepted for import into those countries. To that end  the provisions applicable to Poland by virtue of Article 20(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999(6)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1368/2002(7)  have been extended to the countries and products concerned. A derogation should therefore be made from Article 31(10) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (6) Article 20(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 obliges operators to present a certified copy of the export licence and the corresponding export declaration to the competent authorities when the products referred to in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 are imported to the destinations referred to in that Annex. The export licence must bear special indications guaranteeing that the products concerned have not received an export refund. The authorities of the third countries concerned are to verify compliance with the provisions of Article 20b of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999. (7) Account should be taken of these special arrangements when applying Regulations (EC) No 1255/1999 and (EC) No 800/1999 so as to avoid imposing on exporters unnecessary financial charges during their trade with third countries. To that end  when the lowest refund rate is determined the rates fixed on the conditions and for the particular destination concerned should not be taken into account. (8) For the sake of clarity  Commission Regulation (EC) No 2886/2000 of 27 December 2000 derogating from Article 31(10) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards proof of arrival at destination in the case of differentiated refunds and laying down detailed rules for the application of the lowest export refund rate for certain milk products(8)  which lays down similar provisions for the export of certain products to Poland  should be repealed. The provisions of that Regulation should be incorporated into this Regulation.

(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

(2) The other Member States were informed of Germany's request by letter of 16 January 2002. (3) Article 21(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC  in the version of Article 28g of the said Directive  stipulates that  under the internal system  the taxable person supplying taxable goods or services is normally liable to pay value added tax (VAT). (4) The purpose of the derogation requested by Germany is to make the recipient liable for the value added tax due firstly on the supply  outside a judicial liquidation procedure  of goods provided as security by one VAT taxable person to another in execution of that security and secondly on the supply of immovable property sold at public auction to another VAT taxable person in the course of the judicial liquidation of the enterprise that owned the immovable property sold. (5) This derogation is intended to simplify the collection of the tax insofar as  in practice  the person normally liable for the tax is  in the instances for which the derogation is sought  generally prevented by financial difficulties from paying the VAT invoiced. (6) This state of affairs adversely affects public finances in that the recipient of the goods can nonetheless deduct the value added tax invoiced to him  even though it has not been paid by the taxable person who supplied the goods. (7) By designating the recipient of the goods as the person liable for the value added tax  the derogation removes the difficulties encountered without affecting the amount of tax due. (8) The authorisation should be granted until 31 December 2006  which will enable the derogation to be reviewed in the light of experience. (9) The derogation in question does not adversely affect the Communities' own resources from VAT ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) Improvements to the preferential agreements of the Europe Agreement with Hungary were provided for in the Protocol for the adaptation of the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States  of the one part  and the Republic of Hungary  of the other part  to take into account the accession of the Republic of Austria  the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the results of the agricultural negotiations of the Uruguay Round including the improvements of the existing preferential regime(2). The Council approved the abovementioned Protocol on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 1999/67/EC(3). (3) In accordance with the directives adopted by the Council on 30 March 1999  the Commission and the Republic of Hungary concluded on 14 April 2000 negotiations on a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement. (4) The new Additional Protocol  which provides for additional agricultural concessions  will be based on Article 20(5) of the Europe Agreement  establishing that the Community and Hungary are to examine in the Association Council  product by product and on an ordely and reciprocal basis  the possibility of granting each other further concessions. (5) A swift implementation of the adjustments forms an essential part of the results of the negotiations for the conclusion of a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement with Hungary. (6) It is therefore appropriate to provide for the adjustment  as an autonomous and transitional measure  of the agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Hungary. (7) The Republic of Hungary will make all useful legislative provisions  on an autonomous and transitional basis  in order to enable a rapid and simultaneous implementation of the adaptation of the agricultural concessions of the Republic of Hungary provided for in the Europe Agreement.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2) specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. (2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kg for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (6) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

The application was lodged by Joint Stock Company Acron (the applicant)  an exporting producer in Russia (the country concerned). B.   PRODUCT (2) The product under review is mixtures of urea and ammonium nitrate in aqueous or ammoniacal solution originating in Russia (the product concerned)  currently classifiable within CN code 3102 80 00. C.   EXISTING MEASURES (3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1911/2006 (2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Russia  and produced by the applicant  are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of EUR 20 11 per tonne with the exception of one company expressly mentioned which is subject to an individual duty. D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW (4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based  i.e.  the period from 1 June 1998 to 31 May 1999 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures. (5) The applicant further alleges that it began exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period. E.   PROCEDURE (6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given and opportunity to comment. No comments have been received. (7) Having examined the evidence available  the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review  pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  with a view to determine the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and  should dumping be found  the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject. (8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established  it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1911/2006. (a) Questionnaires (b) Collection of information and holding of hearings F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation  the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time  such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation  in order to ensure that  should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant  anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding. G.   TIME LIMITS (10) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: (a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation; (b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. H.   NON-COOPERATION (11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made  in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially  and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation  the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA (13) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).

He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services  offering  where necessary  mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this investigation  in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file  confidentiality  extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination. (4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 of 30 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards trade with third countries in the sugar sector (2).

Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore  refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished.

(2) A new Protocol setting out fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the ‘new Protocol’) has been provisionally applied since 1 January 2013. The new Protocol grants EU vessels fishing opportunities in waters in which the Republic of Madagascar exercises its sovereignty or jurisdiction with regard to fishing. The allocation of fishing opportunities granted to the Union under the new Protocol was established by Council Regulation 1258/2012 (2). (3) On 26 September 2012  the Joint Committee  provided for in the Partnership Agreement  examined the issue of sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)  which sharks are the subject of IOTC Resolution 05/05 and the fishing of which is authorised within the framework of the Partnership Agreement. It concluded  on the basis of records of catches for the period 2007-2011 of surface longliners authorised to fish under the previous protocol to the Partnership Agreement  as validated by the relevant scientific institutes  that it would be appropriate to limit shark catches by such vessels to a maximum of 200 tonnes annually from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2014  thereby freezing the fishing pressure on these shark stocks in line with the recommendation issued by the IOTC Scientific Committee. (4) In the light of discussions within the Joint Committee  shark catches should be limited and allocated among the Member States for the period of application of the new Protocol. Regulation (EU) No 1258/2012 should therefore be amended. (5) Pursuant to Article 20(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 (3)  the Member States whose vessels are authorised to fish under Regulation (EU) No 1258/2012 may exchange all or part of the fishing opportunities allocated to them with respect to sharks.

(2) In addition  the competent veterinary authorities of New Caledonia have confirmed that the islands have  for at least 12 months  been free from foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest  and that vaccinations against the above diseases have not taken place for at least 12 months. (3) The competent authorities of New Caledonia have undertaken to notify the Commission and the Member States within 24 hours  by fax  telex or telegram of the confirmation of the occurrence of any of the abovementioned diseases  or of any alteration in the vaccination policy against them. (4) Other health conditions must be established for meat not intended for human consumption in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 92/118/EEC(3) and Commission Decision 89/18/EEC(4). (5) The importation of fresh meat of bovine animals originating from that country should therefore be authorised.

For the sake of clarity  the Commission should publish the ceiling resulting from the amounts notified by the Member States for the measures concerned. (2) The budgetary ceilings for the support provided for in Article 68(1)(a)(i) to (iv) and Article 68(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for calendar year 2012 are set out in Annex III to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 564/2012 (2).

(4) On 4 January 2013  Portugal has informed the Commission of the amended support measures which it intends to apply for 2012. (5) According to the information submitted  Portugal intends: — to amend the current support measure under Article 68(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in the dairy sector by increasing the envelope allocated to that measure from EUR 8 8 million to EUR 10 32 million in 2012  — to amend the current support measure under Article 68(l)(a)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 by restricting its scope to bovine females of the ‘Brava de Lide’ breed reducing the respective envelope by EUR 2 53 million  — to introduce a new support measure under Article 68(l)(a)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for the maintaining of certain autochthonous breeds of beef (‘Alentejana’  ‘Mertolenga’)  sheep (‘Serra de Estrela’  ‘Churra de Terra Quente’) and goat (‘Serrana’)  with a total allocated envelope of EUR 1 68 million  and — to reduce the envelope of a measure under Article 68(l)(a)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for extensive pasturing by EUR 0 67 million.

(2) Commission Decision 97/232/EC draws up lists of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of sheep and goats(6). (3) Following confirmation of outbreaks of bluetongue in July 1999  in the region of Bourgas in Bulgaria  Commission Decision 1999/542/EC(7) laid down certain protective measures with regard to imports of animals of bovine  caprine and ovine species originating from and transiting Bulgaria. (4) Following a Commission mission carried out in November 2000 it appears that controls by the Bulgarian veterinary services and the general animal health situation have considerably improved. (5) Concerning bluetongue in particular  a monitoring programme has been set up over a period of time  and based on the results of this survey  together with the information and guarantees provided by the competent veterinary authorities  it becomes possible to regionalise Bulgaria with a view to allowing the import into the Community of bovines  sheep and goats. (6) Some measures must be retained however in order to ensure that live animals of the bovine  ovine and caprine species do not originate from or pass through that part of Bulgaria comprising the provinces of Bourgas  Jambol  Hasskovo and Kardgali. (7) Decision 1999/542/EC should be repealed and Decisions 97/232/EC and 98/372/EC amended accordingly.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

PROCEDURE (1) On 12 November 2001  the Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping by imports of certain filament yarns of cellulose acetate (product concerned) originating in Lithuania and the United States of America (USA). (2) The complaint was lodged by the ComitĂŠ International de la Rayonne et des Fibres SynthĂŠtiques (CIRFS) acting on behalf of the Community producers responsible for over 90 % of the total Community production of the product concerned pursuant to Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation). (3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom  which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (4) The Commission  after consultation  by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3)  accordingly initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of the product concerned  currently classifiable within CN codes 5403 33 10  5403 33 90 and 5403 42 00 and originating in Lithuania and the USA. (5) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country  the representative users  raw material suppliers and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) By a letter of 6 February 2003 to the Commission  CIRFS formally withdrew its complaint. (7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation  the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn  unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. (8) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest. (9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Lithuania and the USA should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures. (10) Any duties provisionally secured on the basis of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1662/2002(4)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 158/2003(5)  for the product concerned should be released ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This restriction was introduced in order to prevent excessive number of applications for licences  which could result in a fragmentation of the market and a risk in a loss of market share for the exporters of the Union. (2) The quantities applied for the quota year 2011/12 were for the first time lower than the quota quantities available. In case of remaining quantities  it is appropriate to allocate those quantities to the applicants who are interested in receiving higher quantities than those requested  provided that the security is increased accordingly. (3) With a view to maximising the use of the quota in the following years  it is appropriate to extend the scope of the licence applications to all the products covered by the tariff quota as provided for in the Economic Partnership Agreement between the Cariforum States  of the one part  and the European Community and its Member States  of the other part (3)  the signature and provisional application of which have been approved by Council Decision 2008/805/EC (4). Moreover  as regards the validity of export licences  the derogation provided for in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 should not be limited only to products belonging to the same product category as referred to in Annex I thereof  but it should be extended to any of the products covered by the tariff quota. (4) As export refunds are fixed at 0 since 2008 export licence applications and licences should show the Combined Nomenclature codes instead of the product codes in the nomenclature for refunds. The relevant provisions should be adjusted accordingly. (5) For the purpose of good management  it is necessary for the Commission to have earlier than 31 August notification on the quantity for which licences have been issued. Conversely  the notification on the quantities allocated is superfluous and can be abolished. (6) Article 28(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 provides that exports licence applications are only admissible where applicants lodge a security in accordance with Article 9 thereof. The exception of Article 9 of that Regulation laid down in Article 33(1) thereof is therefore inconsistent. (7) Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.

According to Article 11(2) of that Regulation  the Council may  acting on a Commission proposal and on the basis of the information provided by Member States and the advice of the Scientific  Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)  exclude certain groups of vessels from the application of the fishing effort regime provided that appropriate data is available on the cod catches and discards of the vessels concerned  that the percentage of cod catches does not exceed 1 5 % of the total catches of the group of vessels and that the inclusion of the group in the effort regime would constitute an administrative burden disproportionate to its overall impact on cod stocks. (2) Sweden provided information on the cod catches by a group of vessels fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat for Norway lobster with a selective sorting grid as defined in Appendix 2 to Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 (2). On the basis of that information  as assessed by STECF  it can be established that the cod catches  including discards  of vessels involved in that activity during the period that they deploy solely that selective fishing gear  do not exceed 1 5 % of the total catches of the group of vessels involved in that activity during that same period. Moreover  having regard to the Swedish control program for cod stocks in the North Sea  Skagerrak and the Kattegat and considering that the inclusion of that group would constitute an administrative burden disproportionate to its overall impact on cod stocks  it is appropriate to exclude the group of vessels fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat for Norway lobster with a selective sorting grid  for the period where they solely deploy the gear in question  from the application of the effort regime laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008. (3) Spain provided information on cod catches by a group of vessels fishing with bottom trawls to the West of Scotland mainly for hake. On the basis of that information  as assessed by STECF  it can be established that the cod catches  including discards  of vessels involved in that activity  do not exceed 1 5 % of the total catches of that group of vessels during that same period. Having moreover regard to the measures in place ensuring the monitoring and control of the fishing activities of the group of vessels involved in that activity and considering that the inclusion of that group would constitute an administrative burden disproportionate to its overall impact on cod stocks  it is appropriate to exclude the group of vessels fishing with bottom trawls to the West of Scotland mainly for hake  from the application of the effort regime laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008. (4) Considering that Member States are managing the effort and the compliance with effort limitations on the basis of the fishing season running from 1 February 2009 until 31 January 2010 and having regard to the fact that Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 was adopted only shortly before the start of that season  it is appropriate that these exemptions be applicable for the entire fishing season and therefore that they apply from 1 February 2009. (5) In order to ensure certainty for the fishermen concerned and to allow them to plan their activities for the current fishing season as soon as possible  it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in Title I  Article 3  of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Tamame of Leopoldo Alas Clarin 16  Zamora  Spain (hereinafter referred to as 'Tamame')  who would be interested in running this service jointly with Udo Bach; and the Spanish authorities therefore  consider that  if the proposed service is authorized for the German operator  it should also be authorized for the Spanish operator; Whereas the German authorities consider that the aforementioned Article 8 (3) should only apply when another operator has submitted an application at the same time as the one which is under consideration by the Member States concerned; Whereas Udo Bach and Tamame have been unable to reach agreement on the joint operation of the proposed coach service between Norderstedt and Alicante; Whereas it can be considered that there is a demand for the coach service proposed by Udo Bach in that there is no direct motor-rail link from the Hamburg area in Germany to Alicante in Spain  which is a major tourist route; Whereas the introduction of new coach services which take private cars off the roads should be encouraged  since this is a safer mode of transport and is also environmentally friendly; Whereas the French authorities  as a transit Member State  informed the Commission by a letter of 3 September 1991 that they had no objections to the service provided that it did not pick up or set down passengers in France and was only for passengers  whose cars were carried separately on vehicle transporters and that such carriage complied with the rules applicable to professional road haulage; Whereas the minutes of the proceedings of the Mixed German-Spanish Committee which have been submitted by the Spanish authorities concern only a given service between Germany and a third country and do not contain a general agreement concerning the  authorization of regular services and special regular services to be operated between the two countries; whereas it is  therefore  not necessary to decide whether such an agreement between two Member States would be consistent with Regulation (EEC) No  517/72; Whereas whilst the Commission appreciates that the interests of existing coach operators in participating in the running of a proposed service should be considered in accordance with Article 8 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 517/72  the negotiations between  Udo Bach and Tamame to operte this service jointly have not resulted in agreement; Whereas the decision whether to run a coach service jointly is one which should be left to the commercial judgment of the operators concerned; Whereas if Tamame wishes to run a similar service he may also apply for authorization to the appropriate authorities; whereas the Spanish authorities agree that they have not asked the German authorities to give their consent to an application made by  Tamame ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(4)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to that Regulation or to assimilated products.

3021,Commission Regulation (EC) No 563/2004 of 25 March 2004 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1)  and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(2) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 7800 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 8(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003(3) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

(8) According to the information provided  a loan of DEM 500000 at 5 5 % from the European Recovery Programme (ERP) and a loan of DEM 250000 at 5 5 % from the Thuringia Development Bank (TAB) were granted. No further information on these measures could be obtained. 3. Financial contributions from other sources (9) Germany indicated the following contributions as contributions from the beneficiary or from external commercial sources: (a) investor's own capital: DEM 170000; (b) a 20 % personal guarantee from the investor amounting to DEM 300000; (c) joint liability of the investors for 80 % of the loans  i.e. some DEM 920000; (d) decision by the workforce to forgo the Christmas allowance  representing DEM 345000. (10) Germany is of the opinion that these contributions have to be regarded as contributions from the beneficiary from its own or external commercial sources to the restructuring totalling DEM 1735000  i.e. 66 % of the restructuring costs. 4. Reasons for initiating the procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty (11) The Commission expressed the following doubts as to the compatibility of the aid with the common market: (a) the ERP loan of DEM 500000 and the TAB loan of DEM 250000 possibly contained aid elements; an information injunction was thus issued; (b) the restructuring plan was possibly not suited to restoring the long-term viability of IGB/HAB since the market conditions in the sector were very difficult and the company was a small company with limited resources; (c) the aid to IGB possibly distorted competition unduly since IGB operated in a sector characterised by overcapacity and the restructuring should have involved some reduction of capacity; despite a request for information  Germany did not provide any details of the capacity situation at IGB/HAB. Accordingly  the Commission issued a further information injunction; (d) the aid was possibly not in proportion to the restructuring costs and benefits since  contrary to the opinion of the German authorities  the beneficiary's contribution appeared to be DEM 240000  i.e. 9 2 % of the restructuring costs. III. COMMENTS FROM GERMANY (12) In its reply to the decision to initiate the procedure  Germany informed the Commission that the local court in Gera refused to set the bankruptcy proceedings in motion because the remaining assets were insufficient to cover the administrative costs. The company was ipso jure dissolved. According to Germany  a continuation of the business in any form whatsoever is thus ruled out in practice. (13) No further comments concerning the points raised in the decision to initiate the procedure were made since Germany is of the opinion that  in view of developments  this would serve no purpose. IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE AID (14) Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty applies to all the financial measures granted by Germany to the recipient undertaking since they confer economic benefits on a specific undertaking which it would not have received from commercial sources. The measures therefore constitute State aid likely to distort competition. Given the nature of the support provided and the existence of inter-State trade within the common market in the sector in which the recipient undertaking was active  the financial measures granted fall within the scope of Article 87(1). (15) With respect to the aid allegedly granted under approved schemes  the Commission notes that  according to the information available to it  these measures comply with the conditions of those schemes and need not be further assessed in this decision. (16) In addition to the BvS grant of DEM 580000  the ERP loan of DEM 500000 and the TAB loan of DEM 250000 have also to be considered as ad hoc aid for the restructuring since no other information is available. (17) The Commission further notes that Germany failed to comply with its obligation under Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty. From a formal viewpoint  the aid is therefore unlawful. This does not necessarily mean  however  that it is incompatible with the common market. As a consequence  the individual measures must be examined under Article 87 of the EC Treaty. (18) Since the other derogations provided for in Article 87(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty do not apply  the measures are assessed under Article 87(3)(c) and under the 1994 guidelines on rescue and restructuring aid(5) (the guidelines). The guidelines are applicable in the present case since all the aid measures were granted before the 1999 guidelines(6) took effect. (19) Since no comments on the substance of the case were received in the course of the formal investigation procedure  the doubts raised in the decision to open the procedure have not been allayed. Accordingly  on the basis of the available information  the Commission must conclude that: (a) the restructuring plan was not suited to restoring the long-term viability of HAB; (b) the aid for IGB unduly distorted competition; (c) the aid was not in proportion to the restructuring costs and benefits. (20) Consequently  the aid for IGB does not comply with the criteria laid down in the guidelines and has to be considered incompatible with the common market. (21) Where an unlawfully granted aid measure has been found to be incompatible with the common market  the Commission is required under Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty(7) to order recovery of the aid unless this would be contrary to a general principle of Community law. According to the information provided by Germany  the beneficiary company has been dissolved by order of the local court in Gera on account of a lack of assets and any continuation of its activities in any form whatsoever is ruled out. The Commission has therefore decided that an order for recovery of the aid in the present case would serve no purpose. V. CONCLUSION (22) The Commission finds that Germany has unlawfully implemented financial measures for Ingenieur- und Gewerbebau GmbH (IGB) in breach of Article 88(3) of the Treaty. On the basis of its assessment  it concludes that the aid is incompatible with the common market as it does not fulfil the conditions set out in the guidelines. However  in view of the facts of the case  recovery of the aid should not be required under the second sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

3057,29.3.2011 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 81/8 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 302/2011 of 28 March 2011 opening an exceptional import tariff quota for certain quantities of sugar in the 2010/11 marketing year THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organization of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1)  and in particular Article 187  in conjunction with Article 4  thereof  Whereas: (1) The world market prices for sugar have been at a constant high level since the beginning of the 2010/11 marketing year. Forecasts of world market prices based on the New York sugar futures exchange market for the terms of May  July and October 2011 indicate that world market price will remain high. (2) The negative difference between availability and utilisation of sugar on the Union market over the last 2 marketing years is estimated at 1 0 million tonnes. This results in the lowest level of ending stocks since the implementation of the 2006 reform of the sugar sector. Any further shortfall of imports threatens to disrupt the availability of supply on the Union sugar market and to increase the internal sugar market price. To limit the negative difference between availability and utilisation of sugar on the Union market in the 2010/11 marketing year  it is necessary to fully utilise all existing import flows: the import tariff rate quotas and the 1 95 million tonnes of imports resulting from Economic Partnership Agreements/Everything But Arms (EPA/EBA) trade arrangements. (3) However  EPA/EBA imports registered during the 2009/10 marketing year were 1 5 million tonnes. Based on the current world market situation  this quantity is unlikely to increase in the short term. This would inevitably lead to a further shortfall in the supply on the EU market. This situation is caused by high prices on the world market for sugar and for that reason  it is necessary to suspend import duty for certain quantities of sugar. (4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 of 25 September 2009 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas in the sugar sector (2) provides for the administration of the tariff quotas for imports of sugar products pursuant to Article 187 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 with order number 09.4380 (exceptional import sugar). However  in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 the quantities of those products for which import duties are to be suspended has to be determined by a separate legal act. (5) The exceptional quantity of sugar that can be imported at zero duty in the 2011/12 marketing year need to be set accordingly. (6) To avoid import licence trading  the rights deriving from the import licence should not be transferable. (7) The level of the security should be set at a sufficiently high level to ensure full utilisation of the issued import licences under the current  volatile world sugar prices.

3062,8.12.2005 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 320/46 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2000/2005 of 7 December 2005 fixing the export refunds on beef and veal THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1)  and in particular Article 33(12) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulations (EEC) No 32/82 (2)  (EEC) No 1964/82 (3)  (EEC) No 2388/84 (4)  (EEC) No 2973/79 (5) and (EC) No 2051/96 (6) lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products  and the conditions for granting of assistance concerning certain destinations. (3) It follows from applying those rules and criteria to the foreseeable situation on the market in beef and veal that the refund should be as set out below. (4) With regard to live animals  for reasons of simplification  export refunds should not be granted for categories in which there is insignificant trade with third countries. Moreover  in the light of the general concern for animal welfare  export refunds for live animals for slaughter should be limited as much as possible. (5) Consequently  export refunds for such animals should be granted only for third countries which  for cultural or religious reasons  traditionally import substantial numbers of animals for domestic slaughter. (6) As to live animals for reproduction  in order to prevent any abuse  export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age. (7) In order to enable some Community beef and veal products to be disposed of on the international market  export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some products under CN codes 0201  0202 and 1602 50. (8) The uptake of export refunds for certain categories of beef and veal products proves to be insignificant. This is also the case with regard to the uptake for certain destinations very close to the Community territory. For such categories  export refunds should no longer be fixed. (9) The refunds provided for in this Regulation are set on the basis of the product codes as defined in the nomenclature adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds (7). (10) The refunds on all frozen cuts should be in line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals. (11) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (8). (12) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore  to be eligible for a refund  products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (9)  Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products (10) and Council Directive 94/65/EC of 14 December 1994 laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations (11). (13) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82  the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %  but not less than 85 %  of the total weight of cuts produced by boning. (14) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished. That abolition should not  however  lead to a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

(2) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 sets the conditions under which special measures may be taken by the Commission with a view to avoiding an overrun of the quantities for which A1 licences may be issued. (3) The Commission has received information which indicates that those quantities  reduced or increased by the quantities referred to in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001  would be exceeded if A1 licences were issued without restriction for hazelnuts in shell in response to applications submitted since 21 January 2003.

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 19 of that Regulation; whereas the same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.

(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination. (5) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) To ensure that imports of the cereal products covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative  they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences will be issued  within the quantities set  at the request of the interested parties  subject  where appropriate  to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for. (3) To ensure the proper management of these quotas  deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.

(2) The Commission  by Regulation (EC) No 994/2007 (3) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of FeSi  currently classifiable within CN codes 7202 21 00  7202 29 10 and 7202 29 90  originating in the People's Republic of China  Egypt  Kazakhstan  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia. The measures applicable to these imports consist of an ad valorem duty  except for an exporting producer in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from which an undertaking was accepted in the said Regulation. (3) In the context of the examination on whether the price undertaking continues to be practical  it was found that FeSi prices continued to fluctuate after the imposition of the provisional measures and the acceptance of the undertaking. Overall  it was found that FeSi prices showed a considerable volatility. Due to the above described volatility of the price  it was concluded that the fixed minimum import prices (MIPs) of the undertaking are no longer a valid form of measure in view of the findings made during the investigation. (4) In order to overcome this problem  the possibility to index the MIPs to the price of the main cost input was examined. It was concluded  however  that the volatility in prices on the market cannot be merely explained by an increase in the price of the main cost input  thus it is not possible to index the minimum import prices. Therefore  it was concluded that the undertaking in its current form  namely with fixed minimum prices is not workable any longer and that the problem posed by the fixed character of the minimum price would not be remedied by means of price indexation. Therefore  it was concluded that FeSi is not considered anymore suitable for a fixed price undertaking (see also recitals 131 and 132 of Council Regulation (EC) No 172/2008 (4)) and that the acceptance of the undertaking offered by the company concerned should be withdrawn. (5) The company concerned was informed of the Commission's conclusions and given an opportunity to comment. (6) The company claimed that the Commission's reasoning for the withdrawal of the undertaking contradicts its Community interest analysis whereby it stated in its disclosure to the company that ‘while the information available shows that FeSi prices have indeed followed an upward trend in the months following the IP  the prices for major cost inputs of FeSi have also increased in the same period’. (7) In this respect  it is noted that the above statement  as confirmed in recital 106 of Regulation (EC) No 172/2008  does not establish a correlation between the price evolution of FeSi and the cost of inputs but was intended to explain the economic situation of the Community industry. Indeed  in accordance with the Commission established practice regarding indexation of the MIPs  the MIPs can be indexed only in cases where the price of the product subject to the undertaking varies depending on the main input. In this particular case  the cost of the main input (electricity) did not show a strong correlation with the increase of the price of FeSi. Even if there had been correlation between the prices of FeSi and its main input  in view of the divergent electricity prices on different markets  no suitable source of information regarding electricity prices exists as a basis to index a MIP  contrary to commodity prices for other products such as oil. Moreover  other raw materials such as coke and quartzite also constitute major but variant components of the cost of production of FeSi. Therefore  if the MIPs were indexed to the price of each of these inputs  complex indexing formulae would have to be established making the determination of the parameters of indexation and the workability of the undertakings extremely complex. Therefore  it was concluded that it is not possible to index the minimum import prices to the price of the main cost input  thus the company's claim was rejected accordingly. (8) The company further claimed that it is against the practice of the Commission to change the level or the form of the measure provisionally determined and/or proposed at definitive stage on the basis of information that covers a period which is subsequent to the IP. In accordance with the clauses of the undertaking  the company was made aware that the Commission may withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking at any stage during its implementation due to changed circumstances from those prevailing at the time of acceptance of the undertaking or because the monitoring and enforcement of the undertaking prove to be impractical and a solution which is acceptable to the Commission is not found. On this basis  the claim was rejected. (9) The company also claimed that the Commission came to a wrong conclusion in its assessment of the effectiveness of the undertaking partially because it used unverified post-IP data. In this respect  it is noted that the Commission followed its regular practice as it primarily used Eurostat data for its analysis as well as the periodic undertaking report submitted by the company. Accordingly  this claim was rejected. (10) Therefore  in accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation and also in accordance with the relevant clauses of the undertaking  which authorise the Commission to unilaterally withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking  the Commission has concluded that the acceptance of the undertaking offered by Silmak Dooel Export Import  Jegunovce should be withdrawn. (11) In parallel to the current Regulation  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 172/2008  has imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silicon originating  inter alia  in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  which will be applicable to the imports of these products manufactured by the exporting producer concerned ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whereas imports into the Community of certain textile products of categories 14  17 and 29  originating in the People's Republic of China (herein after referred to as China) have exceeded the  level referred to in Article 10 (1) in conjunction with Annex IX of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93; Whereas  in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 10 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93  China  has been notified of requests for consultations concerning imports into the Community of textile  products of the categories 14 and 17 on 28 October 1994 and concerning imports into the Community  of textile products of the category 29 on 15 November 1994; Whereas  pending a mutually satisfactory solution  imports into the Community of products falling  within categories 14 and 17 originating in China have been submitted to provisional quantitative  limits for the period of 28 October 1994 to 28 January 1995 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2797/94   (3) and imports into the Community of products falling within category 29 originating in China to a  provisional quantitative limits for the period of 15 November 1994 to 14 February 1995 by  Commission Regulation (EC) No 59/95  (4);

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

3089,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1635/2000 of 25 July 2000 fixing the coefficients applicable to cereals exported in the form of Spanish whisky for the period 2000/2001 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 of 15 October 1993 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the fixing and granting of adjusted refunds in respect of cereals exported in the form of certain spirit drinks(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1633/2000(2)  and in particular Article 5 thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 provides that the quantities of cereals eligible for the refund are to be the quantities placed under control and distilled  weighted by a coefficient to be fixed annually for each Member State concerned. That coefficient expresses the ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirituous beverage concerned on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirituous beverage in question. In view of the information provided by Spain on the period 1 January to 31 December 1999  the average ageing period in 1999 was four years for Spanish whisky. The coefficients for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 September 2001 should be fixed. (2) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area(3) precludes the grant of refunds for exports to Liechtenstein  Iceland and Norway. Therefore  pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93  account should be taken of this in the calculation of the coefficient for 2000/2001.

3090,"COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1895/1999 of 27 August 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  and in particular Articles 8(9) and 9 thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(2)  and in particular Articles 13(9) and 15 thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROVISIONAL DUTIES (1) Within the framework of the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations initiated by two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3)  the Commission accepted  by Decision 97/634/EC(4)  undertaking offered by the Kingdom of Norway and by 190 Norwegian exporters. (2) The text of the undertakings provides that failure to submit a quaterly report of all sales transactions to the first unrelated customer in the Community within a prescribed time limit except in the case of force majeure would be construed as a violation of the undertaking  as would non-compliance with the obligation to sell the product concerned on the Community market at or above the minimum prices foreseen in the undertaking. (3) For the third quarter of 1998  one Norwegian company did not present a report within the prescribed time limit  another Norwegian exporter appeared to have sold the product concerned to the Community market at a price which was below the price envisaged in its undertaking. Two other exporters appeared to have made misleading declarations as to the identity of the exporter and the identity and nature of the sales reported. (4) The Commission therefore had reason to believe that these four companies had breached the terms of their undertakings and consequently  by Regulation (EC) No 929/1999(5)  (hereinafter referred to as the ""provisional duty Regulation"")  imposed provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic Salmon falling within CN codes ex 0302 12 00  ex 0304 10 13  ex 0303 22 00 and ex 0304 20 13 originating in Norway and exported by the four companies listed in Annex II to that Regulation. By the same Regulation  the Commission deleted the companies concerned from the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC  which listed the companies from which undertaking were accepted. B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE (5) All four Norwegian companies subject to the provisional duties received disclosure in writing concerning the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which these provisional duties were imposed. They were also given an opportunity to submit comments and request a hearing. (6) Within the time limit set in the provisional duty Regulation  all the Norwegian companies concerned submitted comments in writing and one request a hearing  which was granted. Following these submissions  the Commission sought and examined all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a definitive determination on the apparent violations. (7) In this regard the Commission's investigation established that one of the companies against which provisional measures had been imposed had not violated its undertaking and that it should be reinstated on the list of companies benefiting from an exemption to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures. The exporter was informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to reinstate the Commission's acceptance of its undertaking. As concerns the other three companies subject to provisional measures  they were informed the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to confirm the withdrawal of the Commission's acceptance of their undertaking and to recommend the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties and the definitive collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duties. They were also granted a period within which make representations subsequent to this disclosure. (8) The Commission's findings in this respect are set out more fully in Regulation (EC) No 1826/1999(6). (9) None of the comments submitted  however  have changed the conclusion that definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties should be imposed on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and exported by the three companies listed in Annex I to this Regulation. C. DEFINITIVE DUTIES (10) The investigations which led to the undertakings were concluded by a final determination as to dumping and injury by Regulation (EC) No 1890/97(7)  and a final determination as to subsidisation and injury by Regulation (EC) No 1891/97(8). While both these Regulations were repealed by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(9)  the facts and considerations established therein remain valid (recital 19 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 refers). (11) In accordance with Article 8(9) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 and Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No 2067/97 respectively  the rate of the anti-dumping duty and the countervailing duty must be established on the basis of the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. In this regard  and in view of recital 107 of Regulation (EC) No 1890/97 and recital 149 of Regulation (EC) No 1891/97  it is considered appropriate that the definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duty rates be set at the level  and in the form imposed by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999. D. DEFINITIVE COLLECTION OF PROVISIONAL DUTIES (12) A breach of undertaking has been definitively established in relation to the three exporters which have violated their undertakings. It is therefore considered necessary that  in relation to these exporters  the amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties be definitively collected at the level of the definitive duties. E. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION (EC) No 772/1999 (13) By Regulation (EC) No 1826/1999  the Commission accepted undertakings from four new exporters  F. Uhrenholt Seafood Norway AS  Mesan Seafood AS  Polaris Seafood AS and Scanfish AS. Pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999  the Commission also extended the exemption from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties to these companies by adding their names to the Annex to that Regulation. (14) The Norwegian exporters already on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted  informed the Commission that their names had changed from HerĂ¸y Filetfabrikk AS to Atlantis Filetfabrikk AS and from SL Fjordgruppen AS to Fjord Seafood Leines AS and requested that these changes be reflected in the list of companies benefiting from the exemption payment of anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The Commission has verified that there were no changes in the corporate structures which would call for a more detailed examination of the appropriateness of these companies maintaining their undertakings. (15) Accordingly  in view of all the above  the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 exempting parties listed therein from the duty  should be amended so as the exemption  from the companies listed in Annex I hereto. The Annex should also be updated to take account of the exemption extended by Regulation (EC) No 1826/1999 to F. Uhrenholt Seafood Norway AS  Mesan Seafood AS  Polaris Seafood and Scanfish AS  and of the changes of name of HerĂ¸y Filetfabrikk to Atlantis Filetfabrikk AS and of SL Fjordgruppen AS to Fjord Seafood Leines AS ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum. (4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 8547 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(5)  should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed. (5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets. (8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period. (9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market  that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto. (10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO  the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2)  provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content  including  where appropriate  other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.

(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation. (6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter  taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g)  the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h)  the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.

(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. (11) In view of the above  refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

Fortunella Swingle  Poncirus Raf.  and their hybrids  originating in third countries where Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus)  Cercospora angolensis Carv. et Mendes and Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) are known to occur. (2) Under Commission Decision 98/83/EC(2)  as last modified by Decision 1999/104/EC(3)  certain third countries were recognised as being free of Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus)  Cercospora angolensis Carv. et Mendes and Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) and certain areas were recognised as being free of those harmful organisms in third countries where they are known to occur. (3) On the basis of information collected in the United States of America during a mission carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) in March 2000  and supplied by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture  it appears that new infestations of Xanthomonas campestris  strains pathogenic to Citrus were detected in Broward  Hendry and Hillsborough Counties in Florida; therefore the said counties should be deleted from the list of areas recognised in Florida as being free of Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus). (4) On the basis of information collected in Brazil during a mission carried out by the said FVO in July 2000  and supplied by the Secretaria de Defensa Agropecuária of the Ministério da Agricultura e do Abastecimento of Brazil it appears that Xanthomonas campestris  strains pathogenic to Citrus have only been detected in the States of Rio Grande do Sul  Santa Catarina  Paraná  São Paulo  Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. The list of areas recognised as being free of Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) should be amended to reflect this. (5) On the basis of information supplied during the above mission  it appears that Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) is present only in the States of Rio de Janeiro  São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. Therefore  other Brazilian states should be restored to the list of areas recognised as being free of Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus). (6) In 2000  interceptions of fruits of Citrus sinensis originating in Swaziland  found infected by Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus)  have been notified to the Commission. The list of countries recognised as being free from Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) should be amended to reflect this.

(2) An examination of the situation on the Community market has shown that between 1 January and 31 March 2001 both the average quarterly selling price and the import price as referred to in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito (Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) were lower than 87 % of the Community producer price in force  as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2764/2000(2). (3) Entitlement to the compensatory allowance should be determined on the basis of sales covered by invoices bearing a date falling within the quarter concerned and which have been used to calculate the average monthly selling price referred to in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 142/98(3). (4) The level of the compensation provided for in Article 27(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 may not in any case exceed either the difference between the triggering threshold and the average selling price of the product in question on the Community market or a flat-rate amount equivalent to 12 % of that threshold. (5) The quantities on which compensation as provided for in Article 27(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 is payable may under no circumstances exceed the limits laid down in paragraph 3 of that Article for the quarter concerned. (6) The quantities of skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) sold and delivered to the processing industry established in the customs territory of the Community were higher during the quarter concerned than the quantities sold and delivered during the same quarter of the three previous fishing years. Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000  the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should therefore be limited. (7) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation  the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 1998  1999 and 2000 fishing years.

(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (5) Export refunds may be set to cover the competitive gap between Community and third country's exports. Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore  refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished.

That Directive provides that special import conditions are to be established for each third country or group of third countries  having regard to their animal health situation. (2) Directive 2009/158/EC lays down the animal health conditions governing trade within the Union and imports from third countries of poultry and hatching eggs. That Directive provides that poultry is to come from third countries free of avian influenza or which  although they are not free from that disease  apply measures to control it which are at least equivalent to those laid down by the relevant Union legislation. (3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 of 8 August 2008 laying down a list of third countries  territories  zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements (3) provides that the commodities covered by it are only to be imported into and transited through the Union from the third countries  territories  zones or compartments listed in the table in Part 1 of Annex I thereto. (4) Pursuant to that Regulation  where an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) occurs in a third country  territory  zone or compartment previously free of that disease  that third country  territory  zone or compartment is to again be considered as free of HPAI  provided that certain conditions are met; said conditions concern the implementation of a stamping out policy to control the disease  including adequate cleansing and disinfection carried out on all previously infected establishments. In addition  avian influenza surveillance must have been carried out in accordance with Part II of Annex IV to that Regulation during a three-month period following completion of the stamping out policy and cleansing and disinfection. (5) Israel is currently listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as a third country free from highly pathogenic avian influenza. Imports of poultry commodities to which that Regulation applies are therefore authorised from the whole territory of that third country. (6) Israel has notified to the Commission an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype on its territory. (7) Due to the confirmed outbreak of HPAI  the territory of Israel may no longer be considered as free from that disease and the veterinary authorities of Israel have suspended issuing veterinary certificates for consignments of certain poultry commodities accordingly. Israel has also implemented a stamping out policy in order to control the disease and limit its spread. (8) The information on the control measures taken has been submitted to the Commission. That information and the epidemiological situation in Israel have been evaluated by the Commission. (9) The prompt and decisive action taken by Israel to confine the disease and the positive outcome of the evaluation of the epidemiological situation allows limiting the restrictions on imports into the Union for certain poultry commodities to the zones affected by the disease  which the veterinary authorities of Israel have placed under restrictions due to the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. (10) In addition  Israel is carrying out surveillance activities for avian influenza which appear to meet the requirements laid down in Part II of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008. (11) Taking into account the favourable development of the epidemiological situation and related surveillance activities for avian influenza in resolving the outbreak  it is appropriate to limit the time period during which the authorisation for imports into the Union is suspended until 1 May 2010. (12) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly. (13) In order to implement the zoning requirements and thereby allowing trade to resume as soon as possible this Regulation should enter into force the day after publication.

(2) Uncertainty is a feature of the market in certain poultrymeat products. The impending adjustment of the refunds applicable to those products has led to the submission of applications for export licences for speculative ends. There is a risk that the issue of licences for the quantities applied for from 31 March to 4 April and 7 to 8 April 2003 may lead to an overrun in the quantities of the products concerned normally disposed of by way of trade.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) In accordance with the second paragraph  subparagraph (a) of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed for a period of the same duration as that for which refunds are fixed for the same products exported unprocessed. (4) Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lays down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (5) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (6) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2)  provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content  including  where appropriate  other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one-hundredth of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation; (4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation. (6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter  taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g)  the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h)  the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (7) The refunds referred to above must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Application of these quotas results in fixing refunds for the products in question at the levels given in the Annex to this Regulation. (9) The period of validity of export licences issued in July 2001 should be limited so that there is no difference in treatment between operators using the licences by 30 September 2001 and those using them after that date.

Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production  and may apply to quality wines psr at the request of the Member State concerned. (2) Portugual has requested that crisis distillation be opened for table wine produced in its territory. (3) Considerable surpluses have been recorded on the table wine market in Portugal  which are reflected in a fall in prices and a worrying rise in stocks towards the end of the 2005/06 marketing year. In order to reverse this negative trend  and so remedy the difficult market situation  stocks of table wine should be reduced to a level that can be regarded as normal in terms of covering market requirements. (4) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are satisfied  a crisis distillation measure should be opened for a maximum of 200 000 hectolitres of table wine. (5) The crisis distillation opened by this Regulation must comply with the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms (2) as regards the distillation measure provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. Other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 must also apply  in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of advances. (6) The price distillers must pay producers should be set at a level that permits the market disturbance to be dealt with by allowing producers to take advantage of the possibility afforded by this measure. (7) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol only  for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol  which is supplied largely by the distillation provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial. (8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However  that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff. (2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market. (3) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 as regards import duties in the cereals sector. (4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. (5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally  the representative market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties.

whereas such imports are likely to greatly exceed the traditional annual level of imports and the absorption capacity of the Community market; whereas  therefore  the beef and veal market would be threatened with serious disturbance endangering  in particular  market prices and producers' incomes; Whereas  however  it is necessary to take into account the application of the Agreement concluded during the WTO multilateral trade negotiations; whereas the management measures provided for should therefore be restricted to products from the third countries to which the Community grants preferential treatment and which have accepted that the Community take measures to manage the importation of the animals in question; Whereas the total absorption capacity of the Community market in 1996 is estimated at 425 000 head other than pure bred breeding animals; whereas  in view of imports planned under certain preferential arrangements for 1996  i.e. 300 500 head under the quota established in the context of the Uruguay Round concerning young male bovine animals weighing 300 kg or less and intended for fattening and under the Europe Agreements concluded with the Republic of Poland  the Republic of Hungary  the Czech Republic  the Slovak Republic  Romania and the Republic of Bulgaria and the agreements on free trade and trade-related measures with the Baltic Republics  124 500 head should be admitted for import in 1996 at the full or reduced rate of import duty  as the case may be. Whereas  in respect of the first half of 1996  Commission Regulation (EC) No 3018/95 (11)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 425/96 (12)  and (EC) No 403/96 (13) have already provided for imports of 89 000 head; whereas management measures should be taken for imports of the remaining 35 500 head in the second half of 1996 with  as countries of origin  the aforementioned countries; Whereas the Commission will closely monitor developments on the beef and veal market so as to be able to react immediately to any changes in the relevant economic criteria; Whereas  in order to take account to the greatest extent of the traditional structure of the Community veal market  imports should be restricted to animals weighing 80 kg or less; Whereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas  in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly  most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of live bovine animals; whereas  so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector  a second allocation should be made available for operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals; whereas in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management  a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported or imported during 1995 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable; whereas verification of those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the same Member State; Whereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the new Member States falling within the first category can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas for those importers  therefore  imports carried out between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1995 from countries considered third countries depending on the year of importation should be taken into account as reference quantities giving access to the quantities reserved for traditional importers; Whereas  so as to avoid speculation  access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1996; Whereas the quota in question should be managed using import licences; whereas to this end rules should be set on submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences  by way of derogation  if necessary  from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (14)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (15)  and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (16)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2856/95 (17); whereas it should moreover be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection period and where necessary with a flat-rate percentage reduction applied; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal ,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(4)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. (2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

(5) In respect of imports into the Community of products for which additional quotas are opened  it is appropriate to apply the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 governing imports of products subject to quantitative limits set out in Annex V to the said Regulation  with the exception of the provisions relating to flexibilities. (6) Requests for import authorisations should moreover be accompanied by the contract signed at the relevant fair  as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where it is held.

(2) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza  there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other poultry holdings within that Member State  but also to other Member States and to third countries through trade in live poultry or their products. (3) Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (2) sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak have to be immediately implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus. (4) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures  including emergency measures. Pursuant to Article 4(2) of that Decision  Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate avian influenza. (5) Article 4(3)  first and second indents of Decision 2009/470/EC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the financial contribution from the Union. (6) The payment of a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to eradicate avian influenza is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3).

(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature  the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed  based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned. (4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Tomatoes  oranges  lemons and apples of classes Extra  I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000 ensures better comparability and transparency among the Member States in the recording of taxes and social contributions in ESA 95 for the Excessive Deficit Procedure. It provides that net lending/net borrowing of general government is not to include amounts of taxes and social contributions unlikely to be collected.

(4) By letter dated 21 June 2001  the Portuguese authorities have requested a transitional period to bring their accounting systems into line with Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000. (5) Portugal has provided to the Commission evidence of the need to improve the knowledge of the parts of taxes and social contributions which are assessed and declared but unlikely to be collected. This improvement will benefit from the new Official Plan of Public Accounting which is being implemented and which is fully consistent with ESA 95 principles. However  the Commission considers that Portugal can be ready for a correct implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000 in mid 2002.

Given the large number of cooperating parties  a sample of Chinese exporting producers was selected during the investigation which led to the imposition of the measures. (2) The sampled companies were attributed the individual duty rates established during the investigation. The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted market economy treatment (‘MET’)  in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation  were attributed the 0 % anti-dumping duty which was established for the sole sampled company which was granted MET. The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted individual treatment (‘IT’)  in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation  received the weighted average duty of 28 6 % established for the sampled companies that were granted IT. A countrywide duty of 47 8 % was imposed on all other companies. (3) Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 gives the possibility to Chinese exporting producers which meet the four criteria set out in that Article to be granted the same treatment as the one mentioned in recital (2) above for the cooperating companies not included in the sample (‘New Exporting Producer Treatment’ or ‘NEPT’). B.   NEW EXPORTING PRODUCERS’ REQUESTS (4) Six companies have requested to be granted NEPT. One company subsequently withdrew its request in the course of the investigation. (5) An examination has been carried out to determine whether each of the applicants fulfils the criteria for being granted NEPT as set out in Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005  by verifying that: 1. it did not export to the Community the product concerned during the investigation period on which the measures are based (1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004) (the first criterion); 2. it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation (the second criterion); 3. it has actually exported to the Community the product concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based  or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity of the product concerned to the Community (the third criterion); 4. it operates under market economy conditions defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively that it fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty applied in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation (the fourth criterion). (6) Since the fourth criterion implies that the applicants submit a claim for Market Economy Treatment (‘MET’) and/or Individual Treatment (‘IT’)  the Commission sent MET and IT claim forms to all Chinese applicants. Five Chinese applicant companies requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation. One company requested only IT pursuant to Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. (7) Questionnaires were sent to all applicants who were asked to supply evidence to demonstrate that they met the criteria mentioned above. (8) Exporting producers fulfilling these criteria may  pursuant to Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005  be granted either the 0 % duty rate applicable to companies to whom MET was granted in accordance with Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation  or the weighted average duty rate of 28 6 % applicable to companies to whom individual IT was granted in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. (9) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the determination of the fulfilment of the four criteria set out in Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005. C.   FINDINGS (10) The examination of the requests established that two companies did not export the product concerned to the Community after the investigation period on which the measures are based  nor did they enter into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export the product concerned to the Community. These companies did not meet the third criterion mentioned in recital (5) above and therefore could not be granted NEPT. (11) Two Chinese exporting producers could not show that they were not related to exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005; indeed they could not successfully rebut evidence pointing to such a relationship. These companies did not meet the second criterion mentioned in recital (5) above and therefore could not be granted NEPT. (12) One Chinese exporting producer  Weifang Stable Casting  that only requested IT  provided sufficient evidence to prove that it meets all the four criteria mentioned at recital (5) above. This company in fact could prove that i) it did not export to the Community the product concerned during the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004  ii) it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005  iii) it actually exported a significant quantity of the product concerned to the Community starting from the year 2008  iv) it fulfils all the requirements for IT and can therefore be granted an individual duty in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. Therefore  this producer could be granted the weighted average duty rate for companies granted IT applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample (i.e. 28 6 %) in accordance with Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005  and be added to the list of exporting producers in Article 1(2) of that Regulation. D.   MODIFICATION OF THE LIST OF COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM INDIVIDUAL DUTY RATES (13) In consideration of the findings of the investigation as indicated in recital (12) above  it is concluded that the company Weifang Stable Casting should be added to the list of companies individually mentioned under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 with a duty rate of 28 6 %. (14) All the applicants and the Community Industry have been informed of the findings of the investigation and have had the opportunity to submit their comments.

3169,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 909/2003 of 23 May 2003 amending Regulation (EC) No 1693/2002 as regards registration of imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings produced by one Argentinian exporting producer THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2)  and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000(3) (the ""definitive Regulation"")  the Council imposed an anti-dumping duty of 34 8 % on imports of threaded malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings (malleable fittings) originating in Brazil. (2) On 12 August 2002  the Commission received a request  pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the ""basic Regulation"")  from the Defence Committee of the Malleable Cast Iron Pipe Fittings Industry of the European Union. The request alleged the existence of circumvention of the anti-dumping duties imposed by the definitive Regulation on imports of malleable fittings originating in Brazil. According to the request  the circumvention practice consisted of transhipment of malleable fittings originating in Brazil via Argentina to the Community. This request was submitted on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the Community production of malleable fittings and contained sufficient evidence regarding the factors set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation. (3) The Commission initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1693/2002(4) (the ""initiating Regulation""). (4) Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation  Article 2 of the initiating Regulation instructed the customs authorities to register imports of malleable fittings consigned from Argentina  whether declared as originating in Argentina or not  as of 26 September 2002. (5) Article 2(3) of the initiating Regulation provided that imports should be exempted from registration if the exporters having applied for an exemption of registration were found not to be circumventing the anti-dumping duties. B. REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION (6) Within the deadlines laid down in Article 3 of the initiating Regulation  the Commission received a request for exemption from the registration and measures from one exporting producer  DEMA SA  San Justo  Buenos Aires. (7) In December 2002  one month after the expiry of the deadline for receipt of replies to the questionnaire  the Commission received a submission on behalf of Industrias Aguila Blanca SA (Argentina)  claiming to be a producer of malleable fittings in Argentina. The submission contained a request by this company to be considered as an interested party in the investigation and a request to be exempted from extension of measures. Given that the submission was received at such an advanced stage of the investigation and well beyond the deadlines laid down in Article 3 of the initiating Regulation and  in addition  would have required further explanations and verification  the company was informed that it could not be considered as cooperating in the investigation. Accordingly  the company was informed that findings in respect of it had to be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation. (8) Any decision concerning exporters should be limited to exemption from registration at this stage. If the Council subsequently adopts a regulation extending the anti-dumping measures pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation  it may also decide to exempt certain exporters from such extended measures. C. INVESTIGATION PERIOD (9) The investigation period covered the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (the ""IP""). Data were collected from 1998 up to the IP to investigate the change in the pattern of trade. D. FINDINGS IN RESPECT OF DEMA SA (10) DEMA SA replied to the questionnaire sent by the Commission in the course of the investigation. The Commission did carry out a verification visit at the premises of DEMA SA. (11) It is noted that  during the IP  DEMA SA only exported one container to the Community. No other exports to the Community took place during the IP or in the period for which data were collected. In fact  the only export preceding the one during the IP took place in 1992. Therefore  there was no clear pattern of trade prior to or after the imposition of measures concerning Brazilian exports to the Community  and consequently no change thereof. Moreover it has also been established that DEMA SA is a manufacturer and exporter of malleable fittings operating its own production facilities for the complete production process of the product concerned. It only sells its own products and never purchased any malleable fittings from Brazil during the IP. It is therefore considered that DEMA SA demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that it did not circumvent the measures imposed on malleable fittings originating in Brazil. (12) In the light of the above findings  registration of imports of malleable fittings consigned from Argentina and produced by DEMA SA should cease. (13) The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to amend its initiating Regulation in so far as it provides for the registration of imports of malleable fittings consigned from Argentina (whether declared as originating in Argentina or not). (14) This Regulation is based on findings specific to DEMA SA and does not prejudge any decision which the Council may take to extend the existing anti-dumping measures on malleable fittings originating in Brazil to the same product consigned from Argentina (whether declared as originating in Argentina or not).

(2) Following the accession of the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia  the said concession should be adapted to take account of the specific arrangements which existed for trade in processed agricultural products between these ten countries  on the one hand  and Switzerland  on the other. (3) To accomplish this  negotiations were completed on 25 June 2004 regarding the signature of an agreement which would make the adaptations to the abovementioned preferential agreement needed to take account of the effects of the enlargement of the European Union. (4) However  as time was too short  the agreement could not enter into force for 1 May 2004  and in such circumstances the Community has to adopt the measures needed to resolve the situation. (5) The measures are to take the form of an autonomous Community tariff quota covering the preferential tariff concessions applied under the agreement to the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia. (6) A tariff quota was set in 2004 for the same product under order No 09.0914 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2232/2003 (3). The new tariff quota is in addition to the existing concession.

That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community  in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established  account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market  on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware  either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68  the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis  provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable  prices must  depending on the quality of the molasses offered  be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price  additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95  specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

In accordance with that method and on the basis of the individual applications ranked in ascending order of quantities applied for  the Commission is to determine the quantities for which the annual allocations are to be granted. (2) In the light of the notifications received from the Member States pursuant to Article 2(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2374/2000 of 26 October 2000 on imports of bananas under the tariff quotas and of traditional ACP bananas for 2001(5)  the Commission needs to adopt the measures laid down herein  to serve as a basis for the competent national authorities to determine the individual allocations for the operators concerned and to notify the latter accordingly. (3) However  the amendments to the Community banana import arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2362/98  and in particular the provisions defining newcomer operators  require the competent national authorities in cooperation with the Commission to conduct checks and verifications  which may not be completed before the beginning of 2001. The findings may result in further amendments to this Regulation and to adjustments to the annual allocations for the newcomer operators. Accordingly  the annual allocations determined by the national authorities pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2374/2000 do not constitute vested rights  nor can they be invoked by operators as constituting grounds for legitimate expectations.

(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.

(2) The results of random sampling and analysis of consignments of dried figs  hazelnuts and pistachios originating in or consigned from Turkey demonstrate that there is a continuing need for the special conditions set out in Decision 2002/80/EC in order to provide a sufficient level of protection of public health within the Community. (3) Fresh figs are not known to be contaminated by aflatoxins and it is therefore appropriate to exclude fresh figs from the scope of Decision 2002/80/EC. Fig and hazelnut pastes have been found to be contaminated by aflatoxins and it is therefore appropriate to include fig and hazelnut pastes within the scope of that Decision. (4) In order to ensure that the random sampling and analysis of consignments of dried figs  hazelnuts and pistachios originating in or consigned from Turkey are performed in a harmonised manner throughout the Community  it is appropriate to fix an approximate frequency for the random sampling and analysis  as well to specify the sampling method to apply for hazelnuts  including vacuum packs. (5) It is necessary to update the list of points of entry for Belgium  Germany  France  Ireland  Austria and Sweden through which the products concerned by Decision 2002/80/EC may be imported.

3191,COMMISSION DECISION of 6 August 1990 concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on the import of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America (Gantrade (UK) Ltd) (90/460/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  and in particular Article 16 thereof  Whereas: A.  PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EEC) No 2357/87 (2)  the Council amended Regulation (EEC) No 1282/81  imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America (3). Anti-dumping duty of 6 % was applied to the  American company Gantrade Corporation. (2) Since November 1987 Gantrade (UK) Ltd  a European subsidiary of Gantrade Corporation  based in Bishop's Stortford  United Kingdom  has been submitting periodic applications for refund of anti-dumping duties paid on imports of vinyl acetate monomer  exported by Gantrade Corporation. The Commission  with the agreement of the applicant  decided to treat the applications as recurring applications within the meaning of point 1.4 of the Commission notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping duties (hereinafter referred to as 'the notice') (4). Accordingly  the applicant has submitted successive applications  within the three-month time limit set out under Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. The information required to assess the merits of the applications has been provided at six-monthly intervals. (3) In November 1988 the Commission received a request lodged by an American producer/exporter for a review of the the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America. On 25 April 1989 the Commission opened the review proceeding covering the period October 1988 to March 1989 inclusive (5). In accordance with point 1.5 of the notice  it was decided that the proceeding regarding the  application for reimbursement opened at the request of Gantrade (UK) Ltd would be suspended until termination of the review. However  the applicant continued to submit periodic applications. Council Regulation (EEC) No 490/90 repealed Regulation (EEC)  No 2357/87 and terminated the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States (6). Thus  since 2 March 1990  anti-dumping duty can no longer be imposed on imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating  in the United States. (4) So as not to delay the decision on refunds  it was decided to process immediately the applications concerning imports made up to March 1989. These applications were examined at the applicant's headquarters. Recurring applications submitted after this  date  or which might still be submitted  covering periods up to 1 March 1990 - when the duty ceased to be applicable - will be covered by a further Decision. (5) The total amount of refunds requested was Bfrs (. . .) (7)  which represents all the duty paid. (6) The applicant was informed of the results of the examination and had the opportunity to submit its comments. (7) Pursuant to Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  the Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the applications' admissibility and merits. No Member State raised any objection. B.  ARGUMENT OF THE APPLICANT (8) Gantrade (UK) Ltd argued that the imports in question were not dumped. C.  ADMISSIBILITY (9) The applicant duly submitted its first request for refund on 20 November 1987 in respect of anti- dumping duties determined between June and September 1987. Pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  applications for refund of anti-dumping duties are admissible if they are submitted within three months of the date on which the  anti-dumping duties were duly determined. The first application by Gantrade UK Ltd is  therefore  admissible only in part namely in respect of duties determined since 20 August 1987. Thus the refunds requested should be reduced by Bfrs (. . .)   corresponding to the duties determined before that date. The remaining recurring applications are admissible in that they were lodged in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation  in particular with regard to  time limits. D.  MERITS OF THE CLAIM (10) All the applications examined  covering the period 20 August 1987 to end of March 1989 appear to be well founded. Indeed  the applicant  in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  supplied evidence that the actual dumping margin had been eliminated by the time the  imports in question were made. The Commission was able to verify all the information supplied and found it to be complete and satisfactory. It was decided to calculate the dumping margin using the method that had been used during the first  investigation. Given that the applicant is a subsidiary of the exporter  the provisions of point 11.2 (c) of the notice were applied  namely all costs incurred between importation and resale  including the anti-dumping duties paid  were deducted from  the resale price to the first independent buyers. It was found that the dumping margin was nil. This development was due to substantial modifications in export prices resulting from significant changes in market conditions worldwide for the product imported. Accordingly  the applications for refund of anti-dumping duties submitted by Gantrade (UK) Ltd for vinyl acetate monomer imported between 20 August 1987 and March 1989 inclusive and considered admissible should be granted. E.  AMOUNT TO BE REIMBURSED (11) A total of Bfrs (. . .) is therefore to be reimbursed to Gantrade (UK) Ltd ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3202,Commission Regulation (EC) No 2245/2001 of 19 November 2001 amending Annexes IIIB and VI to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 as regards quotas for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements  protocols or other arrangements  or by other specific Community import rules(1)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2878/2000(2)  and in particular Article 5 in conjunction with Article 25(4) thereof  Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 establishes the annual quantitative limits for certain textile products originating in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. (2) Following the political changes in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in October 2000  that country is now a full participant in the EU's Stabilisation and Association process and is a full beneficiary of the Community's preferential trade regime with the countries of the Western Balkans established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process  amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98  and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000(3)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2563/2000(4). (3) A mandate for the negotiation of a bilateral agreement in trade in textiles cannot yet be considered since issues relating to foreign trade and customs control within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have still to be resolved. (4) Trade in certain categories of textile products is presently blocked because the quotas have been exhausted. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has requested a 20 % increase in those quotas. (5) It is appropriate to increase the levels of all quotas for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  as was done for Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina for the year 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 7/2000(5) prior to the negotiation of bilateral textile agreements with those two countries. (6) The starting point for determining that increase should be the quota growth rate per category which was foreseen in a Supplementary Protocol to the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on trade in textile products  concluded by Council Decision 90/649/EEC(6). (7) That across-the-board increase should be redistributed to the categories most needed  up to the limits of the increases requested by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. (8) The increased quota levels should apply from the beginning of the year 2001 in order to absorb certain pending import requests. (9) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Commission Decision 2000/609/EC of 29 September 2000 laying down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of farmed ratite meat amending Decision 94/85/EC drawing up a list of third countries from which the Member States authorise imports of fresh poultrymeat (4) provides that Member States are to authorise the importation of fresh meat of farmed ratites only from third countries or parts thereof listed in Annex I to Decision 2000/609/EC  subject to certain conditions. At present  Uruguay is not included in that Decision. (3) Following a Commission mission in October 2004  subsequent follow-up and guarantees provided by Uruguay  the animal and public health situation is now satisfactory so as to allow that country to be included on the list of approved third countries set out in Annex I to Decision 2000/609/EC. (4) In view of Uruguay’s animal health status as regards Newcastle disease  it is appropriate that imports of fresh meat of farmed ratites from Uruguay are accompanied by the model health attestation ‘A’ as laid down in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2000/609/EC. (5) Decision 2000/609/EC  as amended by Decision 2004/118/EC  provides erroneously that fresh meat of farmed ratites from Australia must be accompanied by the model health attestation ‘A’ as laid down in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2000/609/EC  instead of the model health attestation ‘B’ laid down in that Annex. That mistake should therefore be corrected. (6) Decision 2000/609/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

3208,COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 3076/94 of 16 December 1994 introducing management measures for imports of certain bovine animals for the first half of 1995 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1157/92 of 28 April 1992 authorizing the implementation of management measure relating to imports of live bovine animals (1)  and in particular Article 1 thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (2)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1884/94 (3)  and in particular Article 15 (2) thereof  Whereas  as a result of production surpluses and other factors reducing outlets and in view of the potential for export to third countries  there is an imbalance between supply and demand on the Community beef and veal market; whereas an analysis of the  sector for 1995 shows that the situation is unlikely to improve significantly; Whereas experience gained and forecasts for 1995 show that  in the absence of Community measures  massive imports into the Community of live bovine animals of up to 160 kg are likely to ocur  due  in particular to the economically favourable  stockfarming conditions existing in certain third countries; whereas such imports are likely to greatly exceed both the traditional annual level of imports and the absorption capasity of the Community market; whereas  therefore  the beef and veal market  would be threatened with serious disturbance endangering  in particular  market prices and producers' incomes and making public intervention more difficult; Whereas  in order to take better account of market supply needs  instead of traditional protective measures such as that adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1023/91 of 24 April 1991 suspending the issuing of import licences for live animals of the  bovine species (4)  other appropriate management measures should be introduced in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1157/92; Whereas the total absorption capacity of the Community market in 1995 is estimated at a maximum of 425 000 head other than pure-bred breeding animals; whereas  in view of imports planned under certain preferential arrangements for 1995  i.e. 277 200  head in the Council estimate and under the new Uruguay Round quota concerning young male bovine animals weighing 300 kg or less and intended for fattening and under the Interim Agreements concluded with the Republic of Poland  the Republic of Hungary   the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the Baltic Republics  144 300 head should be admitted for import at the full levy in 1995; Whereas the Uruguay Round Agreements are due to apply from 1 July 1995; whereas management measures should  therefore  only be adopted until that date and a quota for 50 % of the 144 300 head opened for the first half of 1995; Whereas the Commission will closely monitor developments on the beef and veal market so as to be able to react immediately to any changes in the relevant economic criteria; Whereas  in order to take account to the greatest possible extent of the traditional structure of the Community veal market  imports should be restricted to animals weighing 80 kg or less; Whereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas  in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly  most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional  importers of live bovine animals; whereas  so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector  a second allocation should be made available for operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a  significant number of animals with countries which are third countries on 31 December 1994; whereas verification of those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the same Member State; Whereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the new Member States falling within the first category can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas for those importers  therefore  imports from countries which  are for them third countries on 31 December 1994 of animals corresponding to those to which the quota refers carried out between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1994 should be taken into account as reference quantities giving access to the quantities  reserved for traditional importers; Whereas  so as to avoid speculation  access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1995; Whereas the importation of 72 150 head during a single short period might excessively restrict economic freedom and would not adequately supply the market in view of the cyclical nature of market needs; whereas  therefore  different import periods  should be laid down; Whereas administrative and technical procedures for the allocation between the eligible operators and for the issue and use of import licences must be established; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No  2746/94 (6)  lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (7)  as last amended by Regulation  (EC) No 1084/94 (8)  lays down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import licences in the beef and veal sector; whereas the correct functioning of the management measures laid down by this Regulation requires derogations from  certain provisions of the abovementioned Regulations; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

That corrective amount must be calculated taking account of the factors referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.

3211,"Council Regulation (EC) No 1469/2001 of 16 July 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)  and in particular Article 8 thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(2)  and in particular Article 13 thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) On 31 August 1996  by means of two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities  the Commission announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding(3) and an anti-subsidy proceeding(4) in respect of imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. (2) These proceedings resulted in anti-dumping and countervailing duties being imposed by Council Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(5) and 1891/97(6) in September 1997 in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation. (3) In parallel  by Decision 97/634/EC(7)  the Commission also accepted undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters and imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway exported to the Community by these companies were exempted from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties by Article 1(2) of those Regulations. (4) The form of the duties was later reviewed and Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 and 1891/97 were replaced by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(8). B. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING (5) The undertakings offered by the Norwegian companies oblige them  inter alia  to charge certain minimum prices when they export the product concerned to the Community and to provide detailed quarterly reports to the Commission of such sales. (6) During a series of visits in November 2000 to the premises of several Norwegian companies with undertakings to verify the data appearing on their sales reports  it was found that one of the exporters visited  Haafa Fish AS (UT No 1/60  TARIC Additional Code 8302  ""Haafa fisk AS"")  had breached its undertaking by providing misleading information regarding certain sales and not respecting the minimum import prices. (7) The Commission's findings in this respect are set out more fully in Commission Decision 2001/544/EC(9). (8) As acceptance of the undertaking has been withdrawn by the Commission  definitive anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties should be imposed forthwith against the company concerned. C. CHANGES OF NAME AND OWNERSHIP (9) One Norwegian exporter with an undertaking  Polar Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/140  TARIC Additional Code 8247 )  advised the Commission that the group of companies to which it belonged had been re-organised and that another company within the group was now responsible for exports to the Community. The company therefore requested that its name be replaced by that of the related company on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. (10) Two other exporters  Hydro Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/66  TARIC Additional Code 8159 ) and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS (UT No 1/145  TARIC Additional Code 8256 ) advised the Commission that their ownership and names had changed  and requested that the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted be amended accordingly. (11) Having verified the nature of the requests  the Commission considered that they are all acceptable since the modifications did not entail any substantive changes which would affect the assessment of dumping or subsidisation. Nor do these changes affect any of the considerations on which the acceptance of the undertaking was based. (12) Consequently  the Commission Decision referred to at recital 7 changes the names of Polar Seafood Norway AS  Hydro Seafood Norway AS and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS to Polar Salmon AS  Marine Harvest Norway AS and Marine Harvest Rogaland AS respectively on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. D. CESSATION OF TRADING (13) The Commission was also advised that two Norwegian companies with undertakings  Delfa Norge A/S (UT No 1/36  TARIC Additional Code 8134 ) and OK-Fish Kvalheim AS (UT No 1/134  TARIC Additional Code 8239 ) had recently ceased trading and had been wound up  or were in the process of being wound up. Accordingly  the names of these companies have been deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. E. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF AN UNDERTAKING (14) Following changes in its trading patterns  Nova Sea AS (UT No 1/130  TARIC Additional Code 8235 )  advised the Commission that it wished to withdraw its undertaking. Accordingly  the name of this company has been deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. (15) In view  however  of the voluntary nature of the withdrawal  the company was advised that it could  if it so wished (and subject to certain conditions)  offer an undertaking again in the future as a new exporter in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999. F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION (EC) No 772/1999 (16) In view of all the above  the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 which lists the companies exempted from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties should be amended accordingly ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) In accordance with Article 66(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007  the competent authority shall take decisions on requests for amendments to operational programmes for subsequent years by 15 December at the latest. However  for duly justified reasons  Member States may postpone the decision until 20 January of the following year. (3) Pursuant to Article 57(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007  Member States should establish the overall structure and content of their national strategy in accordance with the detailed guidelines set out in Annex VII to that Regulation. Prior to 1 January 2009  Member States were free to determine the overall structure and content of their strategies. (4) Some Member States have met specific difficulties in establishing their national strategy  amongst other because they had to involve regional stakeholders. The complexity of the provisions on modifying operational programmes also caused delays in some Member States’ decisions on requests for amendments to operational programmes. (5) In order to give Member States more time as regards those decisions  Member States should be allowed  as a transitional and exceptional measure  to postpone decisions on operational programmes implemented in 2009  until 15 October 2009 at the latest  where such operational programmes have been submitted in conformity with the deadline provided for by Article 66(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007.

However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender.

(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may  if necessary  be altered in the intervening period. (8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

That additional information shows that the name complies with the said Articles. It should therefore be registered and added to the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96(2). (2) Following notification of the application by the German authorities to register the name ""Bayerisches Bier"" as a protected geographical indication  the Dutch and Danish authorities informed the Commission of the existence of trade marks used for beer which include that name. (3) The information provided confirms the existence of the name ""Bavaria"" as a valid trade mark. In view of the facts and information available  it was  however  considered that registration of the name ""Bayerisches Bier"" was not liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the product. Consequently  the geographical indication ""Bayerisches Bier"" and the trade mark ""Bavaria"" are not in the situation referred to in Article 14(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92. (4) The use of certain trade marks  for example  the Dutch trade mark ""Bavaria"" and the Danish trade mark ""Høker Bajer"" may continue notwithstanding the registration of the geographical indication ""Bayerisches Bier"" as long as they fulfil the conditions provided for in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92. (5) In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92  the generic nature of a name hindering its registration must be assessed with regard to the Community situation as a whole. In this particular case  despite evidence to the effect that the terms ""bajersk"" and ""bajer""  Danish translations of the name ""Bayerisches""  are becoming synonyms for the term ""beer"" and hence a common name  the generic nature of the name ""Bayerisches"" or its translations in other languages and Member States has not been demonstrated.

3227,Commission Decision of 11 May 2000 authorising Member States to take measures provisionally against the introduction into  and the spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus as regards tomato plants  intended for planting  other than seeds (notified under document number C(2000) 1312) (2000/325/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community(1)  as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/53/EC(2)  and in particular Article 15(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Where a Member State considers that there is a danger of spreading a harmful organism not listed in Annex I or Annex II to Directive 77/93/EEC and whose presence was previously unknown in its territory  it may temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger. (2) The United Kingdom  the Netherlands  Germany and France informed the other Member States and the Commission on 19 October 1999  12 November 1999  13 January 2000 and 17 February 2000 respectively of recent outbreaks of Pepino mosaic virus on tomato crops  in their respective countries and on the measures taken to control it with the aim of eradication. (3) It is known that Pepino mosaic virus was first described in Peru on pepino  Solanum muricatum Ait. in 1980; there is no evidence that it has been detected outside Peru  until it appeared in the Community pursuant to the aforesaid information; however the source of contamination has not yet been clarified. (4) Pepino mosaic virus is currently not listed in Annex I or Annex II to Directive 77/93/EEC; however  a preliminary pest risk analysis based on available scientific information has demonstrated that Pepino mosaic virus and its damaging effects could be of significant plant health concern to the Community  in particular for protected tomato production; the risk to outdoor production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops  especially potatoes  has not yet fully been established. The relevant services in the Member States have been asked to continue scientific work and to deliver an opinion on the risk of Pepino mosaic virus to outdoor production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops. (5) Directive 77/93/EEC prohibits the introduction of plants of Solanaceae  intended for planting  other than seeds and other than those covered by Annex III  part A  points 10  11 or 12 thereof  originating in third countries  other than European and Mediterranean countries. (6) On the basis of the precautionary principle  it is therefore necessary provisionally to take specific measures against the spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus. (7) These specific measures should apply to the introduction or the spread of Pepino mosaic virus  the production and the movements of tomato plants  intended for planting  other than seeds and to a more general monitoring for the presence or continued absence of Pepino mosaic virus in the Member States. (8) The results of the above measures will be continually assessed in 2000 and 2001  in particular on the basis of information to be provided by the Member States. Possible subsequent measures will be considered in the light of the results of that assessment  and the scientific opinion delivered by the relevant services of the Member States.

3230,Commission Decision of 21 May 2003 allowing Member States to extend provisional authorisations granted for the new active substances iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium  indoxacarb  S-metolachlor  Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus  tepraloxydim and dimethenamid-P (notified under document number C(2003) 1583) (Text with EEA relevance) (2003/370/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1)  as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/31/EC(2) and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC  in December 1998 Germany received an application from AgrEvo GmbH (now Bayer CropScience) for the inclusion of the active substance iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 1999/392/EC(3) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying  in principle  the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to the Directive. (2) The authorities of the Netherlands received a similar application in October 1997 from Du Pont de Nemours concerning indoxacarb. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 98/398/EC(4). (3) Belgium received a similar application in August 1997 from Novartis NV (now Syngenta) concerning S-metolachlor. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 98/512/EC(5). (4) The Netherlands received a similar application in July 1996 from Biosys concerning Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 97/865/EC(6). (5) Spain received a similar application in September 1997 from BASF AG concerning tepraloxydim. This dossier was declared complete by Decision 98/512/EC. (6) Germany received a similar application in April 1999 from BASF AG concerning dimethenamid-P. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 1999/555/EC(7). (7) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations  for periods up to three years  for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned  while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and  in particular  the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by the Directive. (8) For these active substances  the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed  in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC  for the uses proposed by the respective applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 30 May 2000 (iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium)  7 February 2000 (indoxacarb)  3 May 1999 (S-metolachlor)  9 November 1999 (Spodoptera exigua NPV)  21 January 2001 (tepraloxydim) and 26 September 2000 (dimethenamid-P). (9) The examination of the dossiers is still ongoing after submission of the draft assessment reports by the respective rapporteur Member States and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe foreseen by Directive 91/414/EEC. (10) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern  Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for each of the active substances concerned will have been completed within 24 months.

3231,COUNCIL  REGULATION (EEC) No 2727/90 of 25 September 1990 liberalizing or suspending quantitative restrictions applying to certain countries of Central and Eastern Europe and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3420/83 and (EEC) No 288/82 accordingly THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  and in particular Article 113 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 of 14 November 1983 on import arrangements for products originating in State-trading countries  not liberalized at Community level (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89 (2)  applies inter alia to imports originating in Bulgaria  Czechoslovakia  the German Democratic Republic and Romania; Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 288/82 of 5 February 1982 on common rules for imports (3)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3365/89 (4)  applies to imports originating in a variety of third countries  inter alia Yugoslavia; whereas most of the quantitative restrictions relating to products originating in that country were abolished pursuant to Article 15 of the Cooperation Agreement between the Community and that country signed in Belgrade on 2 April 1980 (5); Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/82 of 30 June 1982 on common rules for imports from State-trading countries (6)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1434/90 (7)  provides that imports of the products listed in its Annex are not subject to any quantitative restrictions; Whereas at the Ministerial meeting of the Group of 24 Western nations (G-24) on 4 July 1990 the Community established that the conditions were met in certain Central and East European countries for the extension of the aid for the reconstruction of their economies; Whereas in order to contribute to the modernization of the economic fabric of the countries concerned  primarily by means of an increase in their exports  specific quantitative restrictions should be lifted  namely the restrictions applied in each region of the Commnity to imports originating in each of the countries to which Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 applies  other than imports subject to quantitative restrictions by virtue of Regulation (EEC) No 288/82  and the remaining quantitative restrictions  termed 'non-specific'  which apply to the release for free circulation within the Community of certain products originating in these countries  should be suspended; whereas the Community has already taken steps of this kind for Poland and Hungary within the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3381/89 (8) and Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89; Whereas as regards non-specific quantitative restrictions it would be appropriate to allow suspension  the aim of which is to allow the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to integrate themselves more rapidly into international economic life  to continue for the period needed for economic restructuring; whereas a period ending on 31 December 1991 seems suitable for the present; whereas a suspension lasting until 31 December 1990 for products originating in Poland and Hungary was introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89; whereas it therefore seems appropriate to extend this suspension until 31 December 1991 in order to make its expiry coincide with that for products originating in other countries; Whereas a blanket suspension of all quantitative restrictions for an unlimited period has been introduced for the German Democratic Republic from 1 July 1990 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1794/90 (9) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1759/90 (10); Whereas in the case of textile products it is important to align the trade arrangements for these countries of Central and Eastern Europe on those for all the other countries with which the Community has negotiated bilateral textile agreements; whereas it is therefore necessary to exclude outward processing traffic (OPT) involving these products from the liberalization measures provided for in this Regulation; Wher    these liberalization measures must remain compatible with the economic situation in certain particularly sensitive sectors of Community production; whereas it should be possible to restore some of these restrictions while observing the relevant procedures and rules  in order to remedy adverse situations which might arise in the Community; whereas in the light of the provisions of the Act of Accession (Articles 177 and 364)  provision should be made that the non-specific quantitative restrictions should not be suspended by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic ,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination. (5) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

3242,14.10.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 283/52 COMMISSION DECISION of 13 October 2006 amending Decision 2005/393/EC as regards the conditions applicable to movements from or through restricted zones in relation to bluetongue (notified under document number C(2006) 4813) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/693/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (1)  and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1)  Article 8(3)  Articles 11 and 12 and the second paragraph of Article 19 thereof  Whereas: (1) Directive 2000/75/EC lays down control rules and measures to combat bluetongue in the Community  including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and a ban on animals leaving those zones. (2) Commission Decision 2005/393/EC of 23 May 2005 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and conditions applying to movements from or through these zones (2) provides for the demarcation of the global geographic areas where protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) are to be established by the Member States in relation to bluetongue. (3) As soon as the presence of the bluetongue virus is officially confirmed in a holding  Directive 2000/75/EC provides for certain restrictions to be applied in a 20 km radius around the infected holding. Those restrictions include a prohibition on the movement of susceptible animals from and to holdings situated within that radius (the movement ban). The Directive provides for derogations from the movement ban for movements of animals in the protection zone. (4) It is therefore appropriate to allow movement of animals from holdings affected by the movement ban within the restricted zone for direct transport to a slaughterhouse. Accordingly  Decision 2005/393/EC should be amended to allow for such movements. (5) Taking into account certain farming practices  it is also appropriate to provide for specific conditions minimising the risk of virus transmission when animals from holdings affected by the movement ban are transferred to specific holdings in the restricted zone from which they can only leave for slaughter. It is also appropriate to amend Decision 2005/393/EC to provide for such conditions. (6) Article 4 of Decision 2005/393/EC currently provides that domestic movements of animals from a restricted zone for immediate slaughter within the same Member State may be exempted from the exit ban by the competent authority  subject to a case-by-case risk assessment and certain conditions. However  that provision does not currently provide that exemptions from the exit ban are to be linked to a favourable outcome of the risk assessment. It is appropriate and more transparent to require that such exemptions are to be granted following the favourable outcome of the risk assessment. (7) The exemption from the exit ban for animals leaving the restricted zones for intra-Community trade  currently provided for in Article 5(1) of Decision 2005/393/EC  include animal health conditions for domestic movements to a holding  as laid down in Article 3 of the Decision  and the prior approval of the Member State of destination. (8) In the interests of consistency  it is appropriate that the animal health conditions laid down in Article 4 of Decision 2005/393/EC for the exemption from the exit ban for domestic movements for slaughter  together with the prior approval of the Member State of destination  also apply to the exemption from the exit ban for animals destined for direct slaughter in another Member State. (9) The provisions in Annex II to Decision 2005/393/EC relating to the movements of live animals of species susceptible to bluetongue and their semen  ova and embryos from restricted zones should be in line with those conditions laid down in Chapter 2.2.13 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). (10) Intra-Community trade in frozen semen complying with the conditions set out in Annex II to Decision 2005/393/EC should not require the prior movement approval of the Member State of destination  as post-collection testing verifies beyond doubt the absence of the disease in the donor animal. (11) France and Germany informed the Commission of the need to adapt the restricted zone related to those Member States. Accordingly  it is appropriate to amend Annex I to Decision 2005/393/EC.

(2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports  in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However  the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets. (3) For certain Union producers of sugar and isoglucose  exports from the Union represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Union. Exports of sugar and isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose exports so that the EU producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets. (4) For the 2012/2013 marketing year it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit initially at 650 000 tonnes  in white sugar equivalent  for out-of-quota sugar exports and 70 000 tonnes  in dry matter  for out-of-quota isoglucose would correspond to the market demand. (5) Exports of sugar from the Union to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Union products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particularly favourable competitive position. In view of the absence of appropriate instruments of mutual assistance to fight against irregularities and in order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the reimport or reintroduction into the Union of out-of-quota sugar  certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations. (6) In view of the estimated lower risks for eventual frauds regarding isoglucose due to the nature of the product it is not necessary to restrict the eligible destinations for the export of out-of-quota isoglucose.

3263,21.1.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 17/1 COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 101/2006 of 20 January 2006 amending Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 extending definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India  to imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consigned from Brazil and from Israel  whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic anti-dumping Regulation’)  and in particular Articles 11(4) and 13(4) thereof  and to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (2) (‘the basic anti-subsidy Regulation’) and in particular Articles 20 and 23(3) thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   MEASURES IN FORCE (1) The Council  by Regulations (EC) No 1676/2001 (3) and (EC) No 2597/1999 (4) imposed anti-dumping and countervailing measures respectively on polyethylene terephthalate (‘PET’) film originating  inter alia  in India. (2) By Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 (5) and (EC) No 1976/2004 (6)  the Council extended these measures to PET film consigned from Israel and from Brazil (‘the extended measures’) with the exception of imports produced by one Brazilian company  Terphane Ltda  and one Israeli company  Jolybar Ltd  specifically mentioned in each of those regulations. (3) On 10 December 2004 (7)  the Commission initiated an expiry review of the definitive countervailing measures on the basis of Article 18 of the basic anti-subsidy (see 1st recital) Regulation. The repeal or continuation of the extended measures will depend on the findings of that investigation. B.   CURRENT INVESTIGATION 1.   Request for a review (4) The Commission subsequently received a request for an exemption from the extended measures pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20 and 23(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. The application was lodged by Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Ltd  Kibbutz Hanita  22885  Israel (‘Hanita’)  a producer in Israel (‘the country concerned’). 2.   Initiation of a review (5) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by Hanita and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20 and 23(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting Hanita an exemption from the extended measures. After consultation of the Advisory Committee  and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment  the Commission initiated  by Regulation (EC) No 1370/2005 (8)  a review of Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 with regard to Hanita. (6) The Regulation initiating the review repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1975/2004 with regard to imports of the product under investigation consigned from Israel by Hanita. Simultaneously  pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation  customs authorities were directed to take appropriate steps to register such imports. 3.   Product concerned (7) The product concerned is  as defined in the original investigation  polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India  normally declared under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (‘the product concerned’). (8) It is considered that the product concerned and PET film consigned from Israel to the Community under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (‘the product under review’) have the same basic technical  physical and chemical characteristics and the same uses. Therefore  they are considered as like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 1(5) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. 4.   Investigation (9) The Commission officially advised Hanita and the representatives of the country concerned of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were invited to make their views known and informed of the possibility to request a hearing. No such request was  however  received. (10) The Commission also sent out a questionnaire to Hanita and received a satisfactory reply within the relevant deadline. The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the purposes of the review. A verification visit was carried out at Hanita’s premises. 5.   Investigation period (11) The investigation covered the period from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2005 (‘the IP’). Data was collected from 2001 up to the end of the IP to investigate any change in the pattern of trade. C.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (12) The investigation confirmed that Hanita did not export the product under review to the Community during the investigation period of the investigation that led to the extended measures  i.e. 1 January to 31 December 2003. Hanita's first exports of the product under review occurred subsequent to the extension of measures. (13) Furthermore  according to documentary evidence submitted  Hanita was able to satisfactorily demonstrate that it did not have any direct or indirect links with any of the Indian exporting producers or Israeli companies subject to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force. (14) As already mentioned at recital (12)  Hanita's exports to the Community of the product under review first occurred after the extension of measures. Hanita converts and slits purchased PET film and produces a range of products  some of which fall under the same CN codes as the product concerned. The PET film processed by Hanita and exported to the Community does not use any inputs from India. It is therefore concluded that this is not a practice constituting circumvention. D.   AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED (15) In accordance with the above findings that Hanita was found not to have circumvented the measures in force  the company should be exempted from the extended measures. (16) The registration of imports of PET film consigned from Israel by Hanita  as imposed by the initiating Regulation  should cease. In accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation  which provides that measures shall be applied against registered imports from the date of registration  no anti-dumping duty should be collected on imports of PET film consigned from Israel by Hanita which entered the Community under registration imposed by the initiating Regulation. (17) The exemption from the extended measures granted to PET film produced by Hanita shall  in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 23(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation  remain valid under the requirement that it is not established that the exemption was granted on the basis of false or misleading information submitted by the company concerned. Should prima facie evidence indicate otherwise  an investigation may be initiated by the Commission to establish if withdrawal of the exemption is warranted. (18) The exemption from the extended measures of imports of PET film from Hanita was established on the basis of the findings of the present review. This exemption is thus exclusively applicable to imports of PET film consigned from Israel and produced by that specific legal entity. Imported PET film produced or consigned by any company not specifically mentioned in Article 1(1) of Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 with its name and address  including entities related to those specifically mentioned  cannot benefit from the exemption and should be subject to the residual duty rate as imposed by Regulations (EC) No 1676/2001 and (EC) No 2597/1999. E.   PROCEDURE (19) Hanita and all other interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to grant an exemption to Hanita from the extended measures and no comments were received ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3267,Council Regulation (EC) No 236/2004 of 10 February 2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 1339/2002 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China and India THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1) (the basic Regulation)  and in particular Article 12(3) thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE 1. Original measures (1) In July 2002  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty (the original measure) on imports of sulphanilic acid originating  inter alia  in the People's Republic of China by Regulation (EC) No 1339/2002(2). The country-wide duty rate applicable to the net  free-at-Community frontier price  is 21 %. 2. Request for an anti-absorption reinvestigation (2) On 12 May 2003  a request for a reinvestigation of the measure referred to in recital 1 was lodged pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation. The request was submitted by Sorochimie and Quimigal (the applicants)  two producers representing 100 % of the Community production of sulphanilic acid. (3) The applicants submitted sufficient information showing that the anti-dumping duty imposed on sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China has not led to sufficient movement in the prices in the Community. In fact  the evidence contained in the request showed that export prices and prices delivered (duty unpaid) to final customers in the Community fell significantly following the imposition of the anti-dumping measures  suggesting an increase in dumping which impeded the intended remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures in force. 3. The anti-absorption reinvestigation (4) On 26 June 2003  the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union(3) the initiation of a reinvestigation  pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation  of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China. (5) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country  importers and users of the initiation of the reinvestigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned. (6) Two complete questionnaire replies were received from a Chinese exporter  Sinochem Hebei import and export corporation (Sinochem)  and from a user importing directly the product concerned from the People's Republic of China  3V Sigma  Italy (3V Sigma). It has to be noted  that the investigation which led to the imposition of the original measures (the original investigation) established that sulphanilic acid is imported into the Community directly by the final users of this product. (7) Three other importers/users declared that they would not reply to the questionnaire because they had only imported very marginal quantities of the product concerned during the investigation period. A fourth importer/user submitted some information but stopped cooperating in the course of the investigation. (8) The investigation period of this reinvestigation (new IP) ran from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003. The new IP was used to determine the current level of export prices and the level of the prices delivered to the final customer in the Community. In establishing whether the prices in the Community had moved sufficiently  the price levels charged during the new IP were compared to those charged during the original investigation period (original IP) which had covered the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. (9) Because of duly justified exceptional circumstances (i.e. the consequences of the SARS epidemic in the People's Republic of China)  the cooperating parties requested and were granted extensions to submit their replies. For this reason  the reinvestigation slightly exceeded the normal period of six months provided for in Article 12(4) of the basic Regulation. B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION (10) The product concerned by the request and for which the reinvestigation was initiated is the same as in the original investigation  i.e. sulphanilic acid  normally classified within CN code ex 2921 42 10 (TARIC code 2921 42 10 60 ). Sulphanilic acid is a chemical product used as raw material in the production of optical brighteners  concrete additives  food colorants and speciality dyes. C. THE REINVESTIGATION (11) The purpose of this reinvestigation is  first  to establish whether or not there was a sufficient movement in prices in the Community of sulphanilic acid originating in China further to the imposition of the aforementioned anti-dumping measures. As a second step  where it is concluded that absorption took place  the dumping margin is recalculated. In accordance with Article 12 of the basic Regulation  importers/users and exporters are provided with an opportunity to submit evidence that could justify a lack of movement in prices in the Community following the imposition of measures for reasons other than absorption of the anti-dumping duty. 1. Movement of prices in the Community 1.1. General (12) As mentioned above  the pattern of trade for sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China is characterised by the absence of intermediaries such as traders importing the product in the Community for resale. Users in the Community  which are generally large chemical companies  directly import the product concerned from the People's Republic of China  for their own internal consumption. (13) Therefore  in the absence of any resale price in the market  the Community price level during the new IP of the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China was determined by adding to the cif price in euro at the Community border both the conventional and the anti-dumping duties payable. The cif price in euro at the Community border was established on the basis of information submitted by the aforementioned cooperating Chinese exporting producer and importer/user in the Community. Together  these companies reported data amounting to 1430 tonnes of sulphanilic acid during the new IP  a level exceeding slightly the statistical information available from Eurostat. (14) The movement of prices in the Community was assessed by comparing  for the same delivery conditions  the average price  including duties  referred to in recital 13  of the new IP with that determined in the original IP  plus the duties. The comparison showed that the average price in the Community of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China had decreased by 18 1 %. (15) It should be noted that the average conventional duty rate applicable to imports of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China declined from 8 5 to 7 4 % between the two IPs. Taking this effect out  the decrease in cif prices in euro between the two IPs was 17 4 %. 1.2. Claims made by interested parties 1.2.1. Exchange rate variation (16) Several interested parties noted that sulphanilic acid imported from the People's Republic of China is invoiced in US dollars. They indicated that the decrease of export prices and prices in the Community of sulphanilic acid would largely be the result of the USD/EUR exchange rate variation observed between the original IP and the new IP. The claim was verified and it was indeed found that the US dollar had depreciated against the euro by 11 4 % between the original IP and the new IP. Therefore  the claim was accepted. However  even when the comparison is carried out by taking into account the effect of the abovementioned depreciation of the US dollar against the euro  a decrease in the level of prices in the Community by 9 3 % is still observed between the original IP and the new IP. 1.2.2. Transportation costs (17) A cooperating party alleged that the decrease in transport costs between the People's Republic of China and the Community could explain part of the possible decrease in prices of the product concerned. This claim was verified on the basis of the actual transport costs reported by the cooperating parties themselves. When comparing these transport costs with the ones determined in the framework of the original investigation  it appears that transport costs have marginally increased  and not decreased  between the two IPs. Therefore  the claim was rejected. 1.2.3. Raw material price (18) Cooperating parties claimed that any possible decrease in the prices of sulphanilic acid would be the consequence of a corresponding decline between the original IP and the new IP in the price of aniline  a key raw material representing some 60 % of the cost of production of sulphanilic acid. It was alleged that the price of aniline would have decreased by some 5 % over the abovementioned period. (19) This type of claim refers to costs of production  and can only be taken into account in the context of a re-examination of normal value. However  pursuant to Article 12(5) of the basic Regulation  alleged changes in normal value shall only be taken into account where complete information on revised normal values is made available to the Commission. This was not the case. For this reason alone  the claim could already be rejected. However  in order to establish a complete picture of all the elements possibly at stake  the abovementioned allegation was nevertheless examined. To this end  exhaustive information on aniline prices during the new IP was obtained from the same source that had been used in order to determine the normal value in the original investigation  i.e. a cooperating company in the analogue country  namely India. On this basis  it was found that aniline prices had increased  not decreased  by around 6 % between the two IPs. Therefore  even if the claim had been correctly presented in the context of a request for a revision of normal value pursuant to Article 12(5) of the basic Regulation  it would have been considered to be unfounded. 1.3. Conclusion (20) It was therefore concluded that absorption of the anti-dumping duty had taken place  as the decrease observed in the prices in the Community of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China could not be fully justified even after taking into consideration the above described claim concerning exchange rate fluctuations. 2. Reassessment of the export prices (21) Since it was established that absorption had taken place and that the lack of movement in the prices in the Community was due to a fall in the export prices it was considered appropriate to use the export prices of the new IP  for the purpose of recalculating the appropriate dumping margins in accordance with the last sentence of Article 12(2) of the basic Regulation. 3. Normal value (22) Article 12(5) of the basic Regulation provides for the possibility of taking alleged changes in normal value into account  where complete information is made available to the Commission within given time limits. As indicated under recital 19  no interested party formally requested a revision of the normal value. Therefore  the normal value as established in the original investigation was used in recalculating the dumping margins. 4. Recalculation of the dumping margin taking account of the export prices observed during the new IP (23) As required under Article 12 of the basic Regulation  the country-wide dumping margin for the People's Republic of China was recalculated by comparing the average fob price established in the current investigation with the average fob normal value as established in the original investigation. The difference was then expressed as a percentage of the cif value determined in the reinvestigation. (24) The recalculated dumping margin was found to have increased to 33 7 %  in comparison with 21 % as established in the course of the original investigation. 5. New level of the measure (25) The original measures were based on the dumping margin. A new injury margin has been calculated as a difference between the new export price determined as explained under recital 21 and the non-injurious Community price computed in the original investigation  expressed as a percentage of the same denominator as used in the above dumping determination. The lowest of the two margins is still the dumping margin. In application of the lesser duty rule  the revised  country-wide duty applicable to imports in the Community of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China should correspond to the level of the revised dumping margin  i.e. 33 7 % ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by a certain percentage according to whether it is husked or milled rice  minus the cif import price provided that duty does not exceed the rate of the Common Customs Tariff duties. (2) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market or on the Community import market for the product. (3) Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as regards import duties in the rice sector. (4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. They also remain in force in cases where no quotation is available from the source referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 during the two weeks preceding the next periodical fixing. (5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally  the market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I  point II  to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore  this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and  accordingly  be fixed per 1 % of the said content. (4) In special cases  the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. (5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. (6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination  where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. (7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial. (8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

(2) Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 provides that if during the period of application  the average import duty calculated differs by EUR 5 per tonne from the duty fixed  a corresponding adjustment is to be made.

3279,COMMISSION DECISION of 8 January 1998 concerning an application for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of woven polyolefin sacks originating in the People's Republic of China (Only the English text is authentic) (98/72/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2) (hereafter referred to as the Basic Regulation)  and in particular Article 11 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90 (3) of 15 November 1990 imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of woven polyolefin sacks falling within CN code ex 6305 31 91 and originating in the People's Republic of China. The rate of the definitive duty was set at 43 4 %. (2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2346/93 (4) of 23 August 1993 amended the above Regulation and raised the duty rate to 85 7 %. (3) On 18 May 1995  Envopak Group Ltd imported one shipment of DHL courier bags made from woven polypropylene originating in China. The goods concerned were declared within tariff heading 6305 39 00. This classification was challenged by UK Customs and Excise which determined on 26 May 1995 that the goods' proper classification was within heading 6305 31 91 and that they were therefore subject to the anti-dumping duty of 85 7 %. The anti-dumping duties were finally paid on 25 July 1995. (4) The final purchaser of the goods  the international courier company DHL submitted an appeal on 20 June 1995 to UK Customs and Excise for a Departmental Review under the UK law implementing Article 245 of the Community Customs Code against the imposition of the anti-dumping duty  claiming that the goods should be classified within customs heading 4202 as travel bags. The classification within customs heading 6305 31 91 was confirmed by this review on 28 June 1995. (5) Envopak subsequently lodged a formal Notice of Appeal on 2 August 1995 to the VAT and Duties Tribunal set up pursuant to Article 245 of the Community Customs Code claiming that the goods concerned should be classified within heading 4202. The Tribunal heard the appeal on 7 December 1995 and confirmed on 16 January 1996 that the classification within tariff heading 6305 31 91 was correct. (6) By Notice of Initiation No 95/C 271/03 (5) and following a complaint lodged by the European Association for Textile Polyolefins  the Commission initiated  on 17 October 1995  a review pursuant to Article 11(2) and (3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of woven polyolefin sacks originating in the People's Republic of China. On 21 March 1996  Envopak Group Ltd made a submission to the Commission that the goods concerned did not fall within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90. The Commission confirmed that it considered that  in the framework of the review  the goods concerned fell within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90 and informed Envopak Group Ltd on 20 June 1996. (7) On 16 July 1996 Envopak Group Ltd lodged an application pursuant to Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation for the refund of the definitive anti-dumping duties paid on the importation of a shipment of woven polyolefin sacks  originating in the People's Republic of China  on 18 May 1995. (8) On 30 June 1997  the Commission disclosed to the applicant the main facts and considerations on the basis of which it intended to declare the application inadmissible. The applicant was given the opportunity to submit comments prior to the final decision. The applicant commented that it found that the Commission had inappropriately dealt with the issue of the like product in the framework of the refund procedure. B. ARGUMENTS OF THE APPLICANT (9) The applicant claims in its applications pursuant to Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation that the dumping margins in respect of the polyolefin woven sacks imported on 18 May 1995 has been eliminated in comparison with the level of 85 7 % of anti-dumping duty set by Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90. (10) In addition  the applicant argued that the product under consideration should not be classified within customs heading 6305 31 91 and  should therefore not be subject to the anti-dumping duties. (11) The applicant further argued that the product under consideration  even if classified within customs heading 6305 31 91 does not constitute a like product and  should therefore not be subject to the anti-dumping duties. (12) Finally  the applicant acknowledged in its application for a refund that it was submitted out of time. However  it claimed that the Commission should take into account the exceptional circumstances of the case  in particular the length of the appeal procedures before the national Customs authorities described at recitals (4) and (5) above and of making the submission to the Commission on the issue of the like product  to grant an extension of the time limit for the submission of the application and consider it admissible. C. ADMISSIBILITY 1. Like product and classification (13) The refund procedure is not intended to address the issues of like product or customs classification. Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation stipulates that an importer may request reimbursement where it is shown that the dumping margin on the basis of which the duties were paid has been eliminated or reduced below the level of duty in force. This implies that the imports of the goods in question had been rightly determined to be covered by the measures in force. Therefore  the issues of like product and customs classification are irrelevant in the context of a refund procedure and have been dealt with in their appropriate frameworks as described in recitals (3) to (6). 2. Time limit (14) Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation states that in requesting a refund the importer shall submit an application within six months of the date on which the amount of the definitive duties to be levied was duly determined by the competent authorities. This submission of an application in due time is an absolute requirement for the admissibility of a refund application  which is not subject to exceptions regardless of the circumstances. Therefore  neither the appeal procedures before the national Customs authorities nor the submission before the Commission on the issue of like product could have had the effect of interrupting the six month time limit of Article 11(8). (15) The amount of definitive duties to be levied is therefore considered to have been determined no later than 26 May 1995. The six month time limit therefore expired no later than 26 November 1995. The application which was submitted on 25 July 1996 should therefore be considered as out of time and rejected as inadmissible ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) France supported the request providing all the information listed under Article 17(2)(a) and (b) of the Directive 1999/105/EC as specified by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1602/2002 of 9 September 2002 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 1999/105/EC as regards the authorisation of a Member State to prohibit the marketing of specified forest reproductive material to the end user (2). (3) France provided evidence from commercial forestry that trees of Pinus pinaster Ait. from seed originating from certain regions of the Iberian Peninsula and which were grown in French regions with the exception of the regions mentioned above  were not adapted to the low temperatures experienced in these regions. The evidence was the catastrophic effects of the heavy frosts on the survival of trees of these origins  in particular  in the years 1956  1963 and 1985. A comparison of the climatic conditions of each individual region of provenance in the Iberian Peninsula with those in the regions of France except for Provence Alpes-Côte-d'Azur  Languedoc-Roussillon and Corsica was properly carried out.

(2) The export refund should take into account the quality of the product processed from cereals which qualifies for the refund lest public funds contribute to the export of goods of inferior quality. It is therefore necessary to establish a precise definition  applicable in each Member State  of cereal grains qualifying for the refund on ‘hulled grains’ and ‘pearled grains’.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1712/2002(5) fixes refunds under the procedure provided for in the abovementioned paragraph for 5000 tonnes for all destinations R02 and R03 defined in the Annex to that Regulation.

(2) Regulation (EEC) No 32/82(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 744/2000(4)  Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2772/2000(6)  and Regulation (EEC) No 2388/84(7)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3661/92(8)  lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products. (3) It follows from applying those rules and criteria to the foreseeable situation on the market in beef and veal that the refund should be as set out below. (4) With regard to live animals  for reasons of simplification export refunds should no longer be granted for categories with insignificant trade with third countries. Moreover  in light of the general concern of animal welfare  export refunds for live animals for slaughter should be limited as much as possible. Consequently  export refunds for such animals should only be granted for third countries which for cultural and/or religious reasons traditionally import substantial numbers of animals for domestic slaughter. As to live animals for reproduction  in order to prevent any abuse export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age. (5) Export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some fresh or chilled meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0201  on some frozen meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0202  on some meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 0206 and on some other prepared or preserved meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 1602 50 10. (6) In view of the wide differences in products covered by CN codes 0201 20 90 97/00 and 0202 20 90 91/00 used for refund purposes  refunds should only be granted on cuts in which the weight of bone does not exceed one third. (7) In the case of meat of bovine animals  boned or boneless  salted and dried  there are traditional trade flows to Switzerland. To allow this trade to continue  the refund should be set to cover the difference between prices on the Swiss market and export prices in the Member States. (8) In the case of certain other cuts and preserves of meat or offal shown in the Annex under CN codes 1602 50 31 to 1602 50 80  the Community presence of international trade may be maintained by granting a refund corresponding to that at present available. (9) In the case of other beef and veal products  a refund need not be fixed since the Community's share of world trade is not significant. (10) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(9)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2319/2002(10)  establishes the agricultural product nomenclature for the purposes of export refunds. Following the introduction of refunds for pure-bred breeding female animals of maximum 30 months of age  the product nomenclature referred to above should be modified. (11) In order to simplify customs export formalities for operators  the refunds on all frozen cuts should be brought into line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals. (12) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products(11)  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2026/83(12). (13) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore  to be eligible for a refund  products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(13)  as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(14)  Council Directive 94/65/EC(15) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(16)  as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(17)  respectively. (14) Under Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82  the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %  but not less than 85 %  of the total weight of cuts produced by boning. (15) The negotiations on the adoption of additional concessions  held within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and the associated Central and Eastern European Countries  aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market in beef and veal. On this background  Romania should be removed from the list of destinations giving rise to the grant of a refund. The abolition of refunds may not  however  lead to the creation of a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

In fixing this maximum  the criteria provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 must be taken into account.

(2) Commission Decision 97/232/EC(5)  as last amended by Decision 2003/111/EC(6)  draws up lists of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of sheep and goats. (3) Greenland was recognised as being in compliance with the requirements laid down in point II of Chapter 1 of Annex A to Directive 91/68/EEC and hence was recognised as a third country that had satisfied the criteria for official brucellosis-free status. (4) Greenland has informed the Commission of its intention not to carry out random sampling for Brucellosis melitensis in ovine and caprine animals. (5) Greenland therefore no longer complies with the requirements set out in point II(2) of Chapter 1 of Annex A to Directive 91/68/EEC concerning random testing. Hence Greenland no longer fulfils the requirements for being recognised as being officially brucellosis free. (6) Decision 97/232/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999  provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14  15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund  in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods’ arrival at destination. (3) In the case of a differentiated refund  Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund  calculated using the lowest refund rate  is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.

(6) Decision 2005/45/EC introduces special provisions on administrative cooperation aimed at combating irregularities and fraud in customs and export refund related matters. (7) In the light of those provisions and in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries  it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate  where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question  not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined. (8) Since the measures laid down in Decision 2005/45/EC apply from 1 February 2005  this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately.

3339,COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2900/91  of 1 October 1991  amending Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 with regard to the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of small screen colour television receivers originating in the Republic of  Korea THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1)  and in particular Article 14 thereof  Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation  I. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (a) Imposition of definitive anti-dumping duty (1) In February 1988 the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of small screen colour television receivers (hereafter referred to as SCTVs) originating in the Republic of Korea (2). This followed a complaint lodged by the  European Association of Consumer Electronic Manufacturers (EACEM)  representing a major proportion of Community production. Following an investigation  a provisional anti-dumping duty was imposed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3232/89 (3)  and a  definitive duty was subsequently imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 (4). (b) General duty (2) Under Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90  duties of between 10 2 and 10 5 % were imposed on imports from three exporters cooperating in the investigation. (3) The duty applicable to other Korean exporters (hereafter referred to as the 'general duty') and in particular to one exporter who refused to cooperate in the investigation and who was known to have exported large quantities of the product concerned  to the Community  was established on the basis of what were considered to be the most appropriate facts available  i.e. by comparing an export price based on the average cif unit price of imports into the Community from Korea with a normal value based  on the average domestic selling price of the cooperating Korean exporters. The margin thus established was 19 6 %. II. REVIEW PROCEDURE (4) In November 1990  the Commission received information from the Electronic Industries Association of Korea (EIAK) to the effect that the non-cooperating exporter mentioned above was no longer exporting SCTVs to the European Community. It was alleged  that this changed situation removed the justification for the 19 6 % general duty and suggested that it should be reduced to the level of the highest duty imposed on imports of a cooperating exporter (i.e. 10 5 %). (5) After consulting the Advisory Committee  the Commission decided that there was sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a partial review  limited in scope to the question of whether or not to modify the general duty. The partial review was  opened on the initiative of the Commission  in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88  by a notice pubished in the Official Journal of the European Communities (5). (6) The Commission officially advised EIAK  the exporters who cooperated in the original investigation  the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant in the original proceeding (EACEM)  and gave the parties concerned the opportunity  to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. (7) EIAK  some exporters and EACEM made their views known in writing. (8) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of this proceeding and in particular received and verified to the extent necessary information from EIAK. III. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (a) Determination of general duty in original anti-dumping investigation (9) As is stated by the Commission in recital 33 of Regulation (EEC) No 3232/89 (imposing the provisional duty)  for those Korean exporters who did not make themselves known during the course of the original investigation  dumping was determined on the  basis of what were considered by the Commission to be the most appropriate facts available  in accordance with Article 7 (7) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. (10) For these non-cooperating exporters  the Commission calculated the dumping margin by comparing an export price based on the average cif unit price of imports into the Community from Korea (according to 1987 Eurostat data) with a normal value based  on the average domestic selling price of the cooperating Korean exporters. The resulting dumping margin of 19 6 % became that applicable to the non-cooperating exporters and was imposed as the general duty  while the imports of the three cooperating  Korean exporters (Daewoo  Goldstar and Samsung) are subject to definitive anti-dumping duties of 10 2 %  10 4 % and 10 5 % respectively. (11) The major reason why the Commission did not consider the highest duty imposed on imports from a cooperating exporter to be appropriate for the non-cooperating exporters was the behaviour of one particular manufacturer based in Korea. This company  was known to be exporting large quantities of SCTVs to the Community  with many of them being transhipped via third countries. It was approached by the Commission during its on-the-spot investigation  with the assistance of EIAK  with a view to securing  its cooperation. However  the company refused to cooperate. (12) The Commission decided  and the Council confirmed  that  in these circumstances  neither the dumping margins determined for the cooperating exporters nor the information contained in the complaint provided the most appropriate basis for determining  the margin of dumping for non-cooperating exporters. (b) Changed trade situation (13) The 19 6 % general duty was imposed on the basis of the facts available for the original investigation period - 1987. In view of the information received from EIAK and other sources  it is clear that the trade situation concerning the above  exporter has now changed considerably. (i) Information from EIAK (14) According to EIAK's internal statistics  and independent data obtained from the Korean Foreign Trade Association  both of which were verified by the Commission  the exporter in question has not exported SCTVs to the Community since 1988.  Furthermore  its total exports from Korea of SCTVs to all destinations in 1990 amounted to only 3 % of the 1988 volume. (15) EIAK supplied evidence that the exporter involved had shifted its production capacity away from colour TV/receivers to other electronic products. (16) The exporter  which is a member of EIAK  had supplied the Association with a signed declaration that it no longer planned to export SCTVs to the Community. Furthermore  it was established that it had converted its production facilities to the  manufacture of other electronic products. (ii) Information from Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry (17) In May 1991  the Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry certified to the Commission that the exporter had now ceased all production of SCTVs in Korea  and provided appropriate documentary evidence. (c) Imports from other non-cooperating exporters (18) The Commission also established that the export volumes of other non-cooperating exporters were extremely small  even before the imposition of the anti-dumping duty. (d) Conclusion (19) In view of these changed circumstances  the Council concludes that the situation which justified the use of a different basis from that applied to the cooperating exporters for the purpose of imposing an anti-dumping duty no longer exists. The  exporter mentioned in recitals 13 to 17 has now ceased production of SCTVs in Korea and therefore the quantities exported to the Community by non-cooperating exporters can only be very small. In these circumstances  the appropriate level for the general  duty should be the highest rate of anti-dumping duty imposed on imports from a cooperating exporter  i.e. 10 5 %. (20) This rate of duty does not act as an incentive to circumvention  nor as a reward for non-cooperation  but constitutes an equitable response to the changed trade situation. (21) The parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations upon which the findings were based and were granted a period within which to make representations to the Commission. Where appropriate  their comments were taken into  consideration. EACEM requested  and was granted  an opportunity to be heard by the Commission with regard to its findings in this proceeding. IV. AMENDMENT TO REGULATION (EEC) No 1048/90 (22) Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 should therefore be amended to reduce the general anti-dumping duty from 19 6 to 10 5 %  with effect from the date of entry into force of the present Regulation. (23) This measure shall lapse on the same day as the definitive anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

The manufacturers and importers have also checked  in consultation with the Member States designated as rapporteur  whether tests on animals cannot be replaced or limited by using other methods. (3) The Commission has been informed by the Member States designated as rapporteur of the need to request further information and testing from the manufacturers or importers of those substances. (4) The Member States designated as rapporteur have submitted to the Commission the protocols on the requested further testing. (5) Article 12(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 provides that in the case of a substance produced or imported as such or in a preparation by several manufacturers or importers  the further testing may be performed by one manufacturer/importer acting on behalf of the other manufacturers or importers concerned. In that case  the other manufacturers or importers are to make reference to the tests carried out and make a fair and equitable contribution to the cost.

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) On 31 August 1996  by means of two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities  the Commission announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding(4) and an anti-subsidy proceeding(5) in respect of imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. (2) These proceedings resulted in anti-dumping and countervailing duties being imposed by Council Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(6) and (EC) No 1891/97(7) in September 1997  in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation. (3) In parallel to this  by Decision 97/634/EC(8)  the Commission accepted undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters and imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway which were exported by these companies to the Community were exempted from the said anti-dumping and countervailing duties. (4) The form of the duties was later reviewed and Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 and (EC) No 1891/97 were replaced by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(9). B. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING (5) The undertakings offered by the Norwegian companies oblige them  inter alia  to export the product concerned to the Community at or above certain minimum price levels (""MIPs"") laid down in the undertaking. These MIPs  which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping  are applicable to different ""presentations"" or categories of salmon (e.g. ""gutted fish  head off""  ""gutted fish  head on"" etc.). (6) The companies are also obliged to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their sales to the Community in a quarterly report of all sales transactions of farmed Atlantic salmon sold by them (or any of their related importers in the Community)  to unrelated customers in the Community. (7) Without prejudice to its right to revoke the undertaking pursuant to Article 8(10) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96  the Commission performs on-the-spot verification visits at the premises of selected companies on a regular basis in order to determine the veracity and accuracy of the information provided in these quarterly reports. In this regard  visits were made in November 2000 to several exporters in Norway. (8) At one company visited  Haafa Fish AS (UT No 1/60  TARIC additional code 8302  ""Haafa fisk AS"")  it was found that for the first and third quarters of 2000 the net weighted average sales prices for ""presentation f"" (i.e. ""whole fish fillets exceeding 300 g in weight"") was significantly below the MIP fixed in clause C.3 of the undertaking. In addition the net weighted average sales price for ""presentation b"" (i.e. ""gutted fish  head on"") during the third quarter of 2000 was also well below the MIP stipulated in the undertaking. (9) Haafa Fish AS had also reported to the Commission several consignments of salmon apparently sold to a company in Denmark  however  the visit showed that Haafa Fish AS had prepared the invoices for these consignments on behalf of another Norwegian company which did not have an undertaking accepted by the Commission. (10) In respect of these transactions  it was found that Haafa Fish AS did not actually pay the supplier in Norway for the goods  nor did it receive payment for them from the company in the Community. It was stated that payment for these shipments was made instead by the Community importer direct to the supplier in Norway  with Haafa Fish AS receiving what was effectively a commission from the supplier. (11) It is considered that this type of business practice is incompatible with the obligations imposed by the undertaking since the benefit of the undertaking is only intended to cover exports made by Haafa Fish AS and not third parties from whom the Commission has not accepted an undertaking. In addition  Haafa Fish AS does not know how much was actually paid by the importer to the supplier and cannot therefore even be certain that the amount paid was at or above the MIP. (12) It follows that in submitting quarterly undertaking reports of ""sales"" to the Community which were not made by it  but by another exporter  and which did not necessarily reflect the real value of the underlying financial transactions  the company made false representations and misled the Commission with regard to its true function as the exporter capable of respecting the undertaking granted in its favour  and also as to the true nature and price level of certain sales  contrary to the requirements of the undertaking. (13) In view of this and the price violations set out in recital  the Commission concludes that a breach of the undertaking has occurred. Accordingly  acceptance of the undertaking offered by Haafa Fish AS should be withdrawn and definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed against it. (14) The company was informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive antidumping and countervailing duties against it. It was also granted a period within which to request a hearing and to make representations  however  no comments were received within the time limit set. C. CHANGES OF NAME AND OWNERSHIP (15) One Norwegian exporter with an undertaking  Polar Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/140  TARIC additional code 8247 )  advised the Commission that the group of companies to which it belonged had been reorganised that another company within the group  Polar Salmon AS  was now responsible for exports to the Community. The company therefore requested that its name be replaced by that of Polar Salmon AS on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. (16) Two other exporters  Hydro Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/66  TARIC additional code 8159 ) and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS (UT No 1/145  TARIC additional code 8256 ) advised the Commission that their ownership and names had changed  and requested that the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted be amended accordingly. (17) Having verified the nature of the requests  the Commission considers that they are all acceptable since the modifications do not entail any substantive changes which would affect the reassessment of dumping or subsidisation. Nor do these changes affect any of the considerations on which the acceptance of the undertaking was based. (18) Consequently  the names of Polar Seafood Norway  Hydro Seafood Norway AS and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS should be changed to Polar Salmon AS  Marine Harvest Norway AS and Marine Harvest Rogaland AS respectively on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. D. CESSATION OF TRADING BY TWO NORWEGIAN COMPANIES (19) The Commission has also been advised that two Norwegian companies from which undertakings were accepted  Delfa Norge A/S (UT No 1/36  TARIC additional code 8134 ) and OK-Fish Kvalheim AS (UT No 1/134  TARIC additional code 8239 ) recently ceased trading and have either been wound up  or are in the process of being wound up. This information was received in the case of Delfa Norge A/S from the majority shareholder in the company and  in the case of OK-Fish Kvalheim AS  from the official liquidator. Accordingly  the names of these two companies should be deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. E. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF AN UNDERTAKING (20) Following changes in its trading patterns  Nova Sea AS (UT No 1/130  TARIC additional code 8235 )  advised the Commission that it wished to withdraw its undertaking. Accordingly  the name of this company should be deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC. (21) In view  however  of the voluntary nature of the withdrawal  the company was advised that it could  if it so wished (and subject to certain conditions)  offer an undertaking again in the future as a new exporter in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999. F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO DECISION 97/634/EC (22) In view of the above changes  the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC should be amended accordingly. (23) The Advisory Committee has been consulted on all of the above changes and has raised no objections. (24) For the sake of clarity  an updated version of the Annex to that Decision is published herewith  showing all the exporters whose undertakings are currently in force. In parallel to this Decision  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 1469/2001(10) has also withdrawn the exemption from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties granted to Haafa Fish SA  Delfa Norge A/S  OK-Fish Kvalheim AS and Nova Sea AS and transferred the exemptions granted to Polar Seafood Norway AS  Hydro Seafood Norway AS and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS to Polar Salmon AS  Marine Harvest Norway AS and Marine Harvest Rogaland AS respectively by amending the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) With the tax reduction it intends to apply  Germany aims at promoting a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels. (3) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth  it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities. The measure is therefore expected to contribute to the Union’s environmental and health policy objectives. (4) Allowing Germany to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to shore-side electricity does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the abovementioned objective  since on-board generation will remain the more competitive alternative in most cases. For the same reason  and because of the current relatively low degree of market penetration of the technology  the measure is unlikely to lead to significant distortions in competition during its lifetime and will thus not negatively affect the proper functioning of the internal market. (5) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that provision is to be strictly limited in time.

3427,14.5.2011 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 125/26 COMMISSION DECISION of 13 May 2011 accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2011/279/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’)  and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EU) No 1036/2010 (2)  the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Union of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina. (2) Following the adoption of the provisional anti-dumping measures  the Commission continued the investigation of dumping  injury and Union interest. The investigation confirmed the provisional findings of injurious dumping relating to these imports. (3) The definitive findings and conclusions of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EU) No 464 of 11 May 2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina (3) (the ‘product concerned’). B.   UNDERTAKING (4) Subsequent to the adoption of provisional anti-dumping measures  the cooperating exporting producer in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik  together with its related company in the Union  AB Kauno Tiekimas filialas ‘Kauno Tiekimas’  located in Kaunas  Lithuania  offered a price undertaking in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. In this undertaking offer  both companies offered to sell the product concerned at or above price levels which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping found during the investigation. (5) The minimum import price (MIP) offer from the companies was based on the normal value calculated for the investigation period. (6) The undertaking offer also contained the provision that the sales of the product concerned would be shipped directly from Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik to the first independent customer in the Union and invoiced either from Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik to the first independent customer in the Union or invoiced directly by Kauno. Furthermore  the companies offered to establish a link between the transfer invoices concerning the product concerned issued by Alumina d.o.o Zvornik to Kauno Tiekimas and the resale invoices to the first independent customer in the Union by Kauno Tiekimas. (7) Both companies also agreed to undertake to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their sales to the Union  allowing for the undertaking to be monitored effectively by the Commission. C.   COMMENTS OF PARTIES AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING (8) The Union industry indicated that it disagrees with the acceptance of an undertaking offer  in particular with a fixed MIP. It was argued that prices of zeolite A powder depend on cost of raw materials  especially caustic soda  and energy and that the market prices are expected to rise. In this respect it is noted that available information concerning the evolution of the cost of production (which includes raw materials and energy costs) confirms that the evolution was linear. The information gathered throughout the investigation suggest that the prices of main raw materials did not change dramatically with exception to the caustic soda in the mid-2009  however this trend was reversed towards the end of 2009 and prices returned to long-time average. Furthermore  energy is not a raw material input and could not be linked with a MIP. The Union industry disputed whether the Bosnian exporting producer and its related company in the Union could be considered trustworthy  account taken of their financial situation. Nevertheless  no concrete and verifiable information was provided to corroborate this claim. The trustworthiness of the aforesaid parties was also questioned since it was argued that they declared on importation the product concerned under various CN codes. In this respect  it is noted that the product concerned is currently falling within CN code ex 2842 10 00 and that the customs declaration is not carried out by the companies offering the undertaking. It was also argued that the Bosnian exporting producer may sell other products in the Union  thus  increasing the danger of cross compensation and that the related company in the Union may provide compensation to its Union clients when selling the product under MIP. In this respect  it is noted that the Commission has not established any systemic danger of cross compensation  in particular as the market and clients for zeolite A powder is well defined. Indeed  the clients that purchase zeolite A powder do not purchase any other products produced by Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik since they operate in completely different markets than the customers of the other products. In this respect  it is emphasised that all parties subject to this undertaking offer will be closely monitored. The Union industry also submitted that the undertaking offer was not submitted within the time period foreseen under the basic Regulation. In this respect  it is noted that the offer was indeed submitted within the time frame period foreseen under Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation. The Union industry submitted some additional comments concerning the calculation method of the MIP and the monitoring of such undertaking  which were however not considered pertinent or justified since the Commission ensured that the proposed MIP is in line with its administrative practices followed with respect to undertaking offers. (9) In view of the above  the undertaking offered by the two companies is acceptable. (10) In order to enable the Commission to effectively monitor the companies’ compliance with the undertaking  when the request for release for free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional on (i) the presentation of an undertaking invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 464; (ii) the fact that the imported goods are manufactured by Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik and shipped directly by it to the first independent customer in the Union and invoiced to the first independent customer in the Union either directly by Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik or Kauno Tiekimas and (iii) the fact that the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the description on the undertaking invoice. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall instead be payable. (11) To ensure that the undertaking is respected  importers have been made aware by the Council Regulation mentioned above in recital 3 that the non-fulfilment of the conditions provided for by that Regulation  or the withdrawal by the Commission of the acceptance of the undertaking  may lead to a customs debt being incurred for the relevant transactions. (12) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking or in case of withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission  the anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation shall automatically apply pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market  export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination. (4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. (5) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For those two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in beef and veal  export refunds should therefore be set in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162  163  164  167  168 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination  especially where the world market situation  the specific requirements of certain markets  or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary. (4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1052/2002(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2).

(2) Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 sets rules for the approval of macroeconomic adjustment programmes for Member States in receipt of such financial assistance  which need to be applied in conjunction with the provisions of Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 of 11 May 2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation mechanism (2) when the Member State concerned receives assistance both from the EFSM and from other sources. (3) Portugal has been granted financial assistance both from the EFSM  by Council Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU of 17 May 2011 on granting Union financial assistance to Portugal (3)  and from the EFSF. (4) For reasons of consistency the approval of the update of the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Portugal under Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should be done by reference to the relevant provisions of Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU.

(2) Under that Regulation it is possible  in certain circumstances  to use other allocation methods  to divide quotas into tranches or to reserve a proportion of a specific quantitative limit exclusively for applications which are supported by evidence of the results of past import performance. (3) Rules for management of the quotas established for 2004 should be adopted before the quota year begins so that the continuity of trade flows is not affected unduly. (4) The measures adopted in previous years  such as those in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2357/2002 establishing rules for the management and distribution of textile quotas established for the year 2003 under Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94(2)  proved to be satisfactory and it is therefore appropriate to adopt similar rules for 2004. (5) In order to satisfy the greatest possible number of operators it is appropriate to make the ""first come  first served"" allocation method more flexible by placing a ceiling on the quantities which can be allocated to each operator by that method. (6) To guarantee a degree of continuity in trade and efficient quota administration  operators should be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2004 equivalent to the quantity which they imported in 2003. (7) To achieve optimum use of the quantities  an operator who has used up at least one half of the amount already authorised should be permitted to apply for a further amount  provided that quantities are available in the quotas. (8) For the sake of sound administration  import authorisations should be valid for nine months from the date of issue but only until the end of the year at the latest. Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify  in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary that he/she has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should  however  be authorised  in response to importers' applications  to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2005 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date. (9) Given that on 1 May 2004 the European Union will be enlarged  the allocation amongst importers of the 2004 quota should be divided into two tranches  corresponding to the Union's current and future membership respectively. Acceding States should be permitted to issue import authorisations only for goods to be imported on or after 1 May.

(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 (2) lays down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide content of wine in particular. Under Article 19(4) thereof  Annex XIIa of that Regulation lists the cases where the Member States may authorise an increase in the maximum total sulphur dioxide content of wine of less than 300 milligrams per litre by a maximum of 40 milligrams per litre because of weather conditions.

(2) This proceeding resulted in provisional anti-dumping duties being imposed in July 2001 on imports of urea originating in Belarus  Bulgaria  Croatia  Estonia  Libya  Lithuania  Romania and the Ukraine and a termination of the proceeding concerning imports of urea originating from Egypt and Poland by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 (3). (3) In the same Regulation  the Commission accepted an undertaking offered by the exporting producer in Bulgaria  Chimco AD. Subject to the conditions set out in Regulation (EC) 1497/2001  imports of the product concerned into the Community from this company were exempted from the said provisional anti-dumping duties  pursuant to Article 3(1) of the same Regulation. (4) Definitive duties were later imposed on imports of goods originating in Belarus  Bulgaria  Croatia  Estonia  Libya  Lithuania  Romania and the Ukraine by Council Regulation (EC) No 92/2002 (4) (the definitive Regulation). Subject to the conditions set out therein  this Regulation also granted goods produced and directly exported to the first independent customer in the Community by Chimco AD an exemption to the payment of the definitive anti-dumping duties as an undertaking had already been accepted definitively from this company at the provisional stage of the proceeding. As mentioned in recital 137 of the definitive Regulation  the minimum price of the undertaking was adapted due to a change in the injury elimination level. B.   BREACHES OF THE UNDERTAKING 1.   Obligations of the company with an undertaking (5) The undertaking offered by Chimco AD obliges the company concerned  inter alia  to export the product concerned to the Community at or above certain minimum import price levels (MIPs) specified therein. This minimum price level has to be respected on a quarterly weighted average. The company also undertakes not to circumvent the undertaking by making compensatory arrangements with any other party. (6) Furthermore  in order to allow effective monitoring of the undertaking  Chimco AD is obliged to send to the European Commission a quarterly report of all of its exports sales of the product concerned to the European Community. These reports should include details of all invoices issued during the period for sales made under the terms of the undertaking for which exemption to the anti-dumping duties is sought. The data submitted in these sales reports should be complete and correct in all particulars. (7) It is stipulated in the undertaking that the European Commission may give further technical instructions for the monitoring of this undertaking and that the company undertakes to cooperate in providing all information considered necessary by the European Commission for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this undertaking. 2.   Breaches of the undertaking (8) The company was informed in December 2003 by the European Commission that a new system would be made available for the company to report the quarterly sales reports to the European Union. This system would be used for the reports from 2004 onwards if the company agreed to it. (9) In return  the company sent an acceptance declaration of the new reporting system for undertakings and continued offer of an undertaking. Further  the two first reports under the new system have been correctly transmitted to the European Commission. (10) Reports for the third and fourth quarter have not been received within the framework of the reporting system. The company was informed about this and was granted a sufficient period to remedy this situation. No reaction was received from the company. (11) Further the company no longer sent any quarterly sales reports for 2005 to the European Commission. The obligation of the company to report their sales to the European Union was therefore not met. (12) The failure to report in conformity to the technical specifications as well as the non-transmission of the quarterly reports constituted a breach of the undertaking. The company was therefore informed in writing of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking and to recommend the imposition of the definitive anti-dumping duty.

The Commission has received a request to open additional quotas in view of trade fairs to be held in 2000. (2) Additional quotas have already been opened for trade fairs in previous years for certain third countries. (3) Access to the additional quotas should be limited to products which have been exhibited by the exporting countries at the relevant fair and for the quantities agreed to by sales contracts  as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where the fair is taking place. (4) In order to avoid an overutilisation of these additional quotas it appears appropriate to request the Member State on the territory of which the fair is taking place  on the one hand  to ensure that the total amounts covered by certified contracts do not exceed the limits set for these additional quotas and  on the other hand  to inform the Commission after closure of the fair of the total quantities covered by such certified contracts. (5) It seems appropriate to apply to imports into the Community of products for which the additional quotas are opened the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 which are applicable to imports of products subject to quantitative limits set out in Annex V to the said Regulation  with the exception of those relating to flexibilities. (6) Requests for import authorisations should moreover be accompanied by the contract signed at the relevant fair  as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where it is held. (7) In order to avoid circumvention  issue of import authorisations should only cover products shipped in the supplier country in which they originate no earlier than 1 January 2001.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

3534,31.8.2004 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 280/26 COMMISSION DECISION of 23 July 2004 amending Decision 2003/804/EC as regards imports of live molluscs for human consumption (notified under document number C(2004) 2613) (Text with EEA relevance) (2004/623/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products (1)  and in particular Article 20(1) and Article 21(2) thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Decision 2003/804/EC of 14 November 2003 laying down the animal health conditions and certification requirements for imports of molluscs  their eggs and gametes for further growth  fattening  relaying or human consumption (2)  sets out the specific animal health conditions for imports of live molluscs into the Community from third countries. (2) It is necessary to take into consideration that imports of small quantities of molluscs  often high-value products  directly for retail sale to supermarkets or restaurants  may represent a low animal health risk  as these consignments are not for further growth  fattening  or relaying in Community waters. (3) The requirements laid down in Council Directive 91/492/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs (3)  and Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products (4)  give the appropriate level of protection as regards live molluscs packed in packages of a size suitable for retail sale to restaurants or directly to the consumer  provided the molluscs do not come in contact with Community waters. Additional animal health certification for such consignments should not be necessary. (4) It is further necessary to take into consideration the possibility that imports of live molluscs  which would not fully comply with the requirements laid down in Article 3 of Decision 2003/804/EC for situations where the molluscs are bound for further processing  could be channelled to import centres approved according to Article 8 of Decision 2003/804/EC  and packed in packages of a size suitable for retail sale to restaurants or directly to the consumer. In such situations  the imported molluscs will not come in direct contact with natural waters in the Community. (5) Live bivalve molluscs should be treated as live aquatic animals where they are for further breeding and production  but they may also be considered as products where they are for immediate human consumption  except that they are transported in the live state to preserve freshness. However  as regards veterinary checks  all live bivalve molluscs should be examined in facilities approved to handle products of animal origin  which are more appropriate for handling such consignments. (6) Live bivalve molluscs imported from third countries should therefore be subject to veterinary checks according to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (5). (7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 of 18 February 2004 introducing a document for the declaration of  and veterinary checks on  animals from third countries entering the Community (6)  has replaced Commission Decision 92/527/EC (7). Where live bivalve molluscs are destined for breeding or production the control procedure in Article 8 of Directive 97/78/EC should be used and the common veterinary entry document in Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 completed accordingly by the official veterinarian. (8) Where live bivalve molluscs are imported and intended for human consumption the common veterinary entry document set down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 of 22 January 2004 laying down the procedures for the veterinary checks at Community border inspection posts on products imported from third countries (8) should be used and completed accordingly by the official veterinarian. (9) In order not to interrupt imports unnecessarily  taking into account the low animal health risk such consignments represent  the control procedures laid down in Article 6 of Decision 2003/804/EC should be amended accordingly  and Annex IV deleted.

3547,18.10.2014 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 300/55 COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION of 14 October 2014 authorising Germany to apply a reduced rate of taxation on electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC (2014/722/EU) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (1)  and in particular Article 19 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission  Whereas: (1) By Council Implementing Decision 2011/445/EU (2) Germany was authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’) in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC until 16 July 2014. (2) By letter dated 26 February 2014  Germany sought the authorisation to continue to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to shore-side electricity pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC. (3) With the tax reduction it intends to apply  Germany aims at continuing the promotion of a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels. (4) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth  it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities. The measure is therefore expected to contribute to the environmental  health and climate policy objectives of the Union. (5) Allowing Germany to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to shore-side electricity does not go beyond what is necessary to increase the use of shore-side electricity  since on-board generation will remain the more competitive alternative in most cases. For the same reason  and because of the current relatively low degree of market penetration of the technology  the measure is unlikely to lead to significant distortions in competition during the time it is applied and will thus not negatively affect the proper functioning of the internal market. (6) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that provision must be strictly limited in time. Given the need for a period long enough to allow for the proper evaluation of the measure  but also the need not to undermine future developments of the existing legal framework  it is appropriate to grant the authorisation requested for a period of six years. (7) In order to provide legal certainty to port and ship operators and to avoid a potential increase in the administrative burden for the distributors and redistributors of electricity which could result from changes to the rate of excise duty levied on shore-side electricity  it should be ensured that Germany can apply the existing specific tax reduction to which this Decision relates without interruption. The authorisation requested should therefore be granted with effect from 17 July 2014  in order to follow seamlessly on from the prior arrangements under Council Implementing Decision 2011/445/EU. (8) This Decision should cease to apply on the date on which general rules on tax advantages for shore-side electricity become applicable by way of a future legislative act of the Union. (9) This decision is without prejudice to the application of the Union rules regarding State aid ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(6)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. Whereas the fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States  the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time. (2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2005 (1 October 2004-30 September 2005). On the basis of the data published by the United States’ Customs and Border Protection  the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 36 91 million. (3) Since the level of nullification or impairment and consequently of suspension has increased  the first eight products of the list in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 should be added to the list in Annex I to that Regulation. (4) The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents  over one year  a value of trade that does not exceed USD 36 91 million. (5) Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 contain specific exemptions from the additional import duty. Since the applicability of those exemptions is dependent on certain conditions being met before the entry into force or on the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005  the exemptions cannot in practice apply for imports of the eight products now added to the list in Annex I. Specific provisions should therefore be adopted to make these exemptions effective for imports of those products. (6) To avoid circumvention of the additional duty  this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.

(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing. (4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment. (5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts.

Given the large number of cooperating parties  a sample of Thai exporting producers was selected during the investigation which led to the imposition of the measures. (2) The sampled companies were attributed the individual duty rates established during the investigation. A countrywide duty of 12 9 %  based on the weighted average dumping margin of the sampled parties  was imposed on all other companies. B.   CURRENT INVESTIGATION (3) On 30 August 2007  after the imposition of definitive measures on imports of sweetcorn originating in Thailand  Kuiburi Fruit Canning Co. Limited (Kuiburi or the company)  an exporting producer which was not selected in the sample but which had provided the Commission with a full questionnaire reply and had requested an individual examination  submitted an application to the Court of First Instance. In that application  the company claimed that it should have been granted an individual examination. (4) Without prejudice to the position which the Community institutions will take should that case be pursued by the applicant  the Commission decided on its own initiative to initiate a partial reopening of the anti-dumping investigation (3). The reopening was limited in scope to the examination of dumping as far as Kuiburi is concerned. (5) The Commission officially advised Kuiburi  the representatives of the exporting country and the Community industry of the partial reopening of the investigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to be heard. (6) The Commission sought to verify the information provided by Kuiburi which it deemed necessary for the determination of dumping and a verification visit was carried out at the premises of the company. (7) As set out in the definitive Regulation  the investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 (the investigation period or IP). C.   FINDINGS 1.   Dumping (8) The methodology used for the calculation of dumping was the same as that applied for the sampled companies  as described in recitals 21 to 36 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1888/2006 (4) (the provisional Regulation)  and confirmed in the definitive Regulation. (9) For the determination of normal value the Commission first established whether the total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with the company’s total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2)  first sentence  of the basic Regulation  the domestic sales of the like product are considered to be representative if the company’s domestic sales volume exceeds 5 % of its total export sales to the Community. (10) It was established that the like product was not sold at all on the domestic market. Therefore  normal value had to be constructed pursuant to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. Normal value was constructed by adding to the cost of manufacturing of each type exported to the Community  corrected where appropriate  a reasonable amount for selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and profit. As in the original investigation  it was decided not to establish the SG&A expenses and profit on the basis of Article 2(6)(a) of the basic Regulation  since only one company which had been included in the sample had representative domestic sales of the like product. Therefore  also in conformity with what was done in the original investigation  the SG&A expenses and profit were determined in accordance with Article 2(6)(b) as Kuiburi had representative sales  in the ordinary course of trade  of the same general category of products. (11) The costs of manufacturing and SG&A expenses reported were found to be understated and were corrected before being used in constructing normal value. (12) Following the disclosure of the essential facts and considerations forming the basis of the findings in this proceeding  Kuiburi claimed that in constructing normal value  the amounts for SG&A expenses and profit should be established pursuant to Article 2(6)(c) of the basic Regulation. The company argued that Article 2(6)(b) could not be used as the domestic sales of other products (i) included non-canned products and (ii) were in any case not representative. As concerns the first argument  the definition of the product concerned does not include any specific receptacle type and therefore is not limited to products packed in cans. By analogy  the same applies to the same general category of products. Concerning the second argument  it is to be noted that the 5 % threshold referred to in Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation serves to determine the representativity of domestic sales of the like product (as compared to sales of the product concerned to the Community). It is not required  for the application of Article 2(6)(b)  that sales of the same general category of products represent more than that 5 % threshold. In any event  the company’s sales of the same general category of products as compared to the sales of the product concerned to the Community  are very significant and  therefore  representative. In view of the above  the company’s arguments cannot be accepted and it is confirmed that SG&A expenses and profit are established pursuant to Article 2(6)(b) of the basic Regulation. (13) Kuiburi further submitted that if SG&A and profit were established pursuant to Article 2(6)(b) of the basic Regulation  a level of trade adjustment on the profit used for the construction of normal value would have to be made as it sells retailer branded products to the EC and a mix of own branded and retailer branded products domestically. In this respect it is important to note that Kuiburi had allocated the cost of sales on the basis of turnover. Consequently  the profit and SG&A amounted to the same combined level in the case of sales of all product types to all markets and the profit figures reported only reflected some slight variation in SG&A. It could therefore not be established that the reported figures reflected differences in the level of trade. As a consequence  no level of trade adjustment on the profit is warranted and Kuiburi’s argument is dismissed. (14) All sales of the company were made directly to unrelated customers in the Community. For those sales  the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation  on the basis of prices actually paid or payable by these independent customers in the Community. (15) The comparison between normal value and export price was made on an ex-works basis. In order to ensure a fair comparison  account was taken  in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation  of differences in factors which affect price comparability. Allowances for differences in transport costs  handling costs  commissions  and credit costs were granted where applicable and justified. (16) The SG&A used to construct normal value pursuant to the methodology set out above  included costs for commissions. Therefore  albeit that no claim had been made in this regard  an ex officio adjustment to the normal value pursuant to Article 2(10)(e) was made to reduce the SG&A by the amount of the costs incurred in respect of commissions. (17) Kuiburi’s dumping margin was established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average export price  in accordance with Article 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation. (18) The comparison showed the existence of dumping. The weighted average dumping margin established for the company  expressed as a percentage of the cif Community-frontier price  amounts to 14 3 %. 2.   Injury elimination level (19) In accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation  the level of the anti-dumping measure should be sufficient to eliminate the injury to the Community industry caused by the dumped imports  without exceeding the dumping margin found. The calculation of the non-injurious price has been described in recitals 120 to 122 of the provisional Regulation. (20) The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison  per product type  of the weighted average import price  as established for the price undercutting calculations  with the non-injurious price of the like product sold by the Community industry on the Community market. Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the total cif Community-frontier price. (21) The above price comparison showed an injury margin of 17 5 %. D.   MODIFICATION OF THE LIST OF COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM INDIVIDUAL DUTY RATES (22) In the light of the results of the investigation  it is considered that a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed on exports of the product concerned by the company at the level of the dumping margin found  but  in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation  should not be higher than the injury margin established for Kuiburi and presented in recital 21. (23) Accordingly  the anti-dumping duty applicable to the cif Community-frontier price shall be 14 3 %. Since  pursuant to recital 57 of Regulation (EC) No 682/2007  the duty for the companies not cooperating in the investigation should be set at the level of the highest duty to be imposed on the companies cooperating in the investigation  that duty is now set at 14 3 %. However  since the reopening of the investigation did not have as its aim to include Kuiburi in the sample  but to perform an individual examination of Kuiburi on the basis of Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation  it would not be appropriate to recalculate the duty for the manufacturers listed in Annex I. (24) Kuiburi and the Community Industry have been informed of the findings of the investigation and have had the opportunity to submit their comments ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination  especially where the world market situation  the specific requirements of certain markets  or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.

(2) In accordance with Article 13(1)(c) of Directive 90/426/EEC and point 2 of Part A of Chapter II of Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC  equidae and semen  ova and embryos of the equine species must come from third countries or parts of their territory  which have been free of glanders for at least 6 months. (3) On 5 September 2008  Brazil notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the confirmation of a case of glanders in a horse in the suburbs of São Paulo in the State of São Paulo. In order to allow the importation of equidae  their semen  ova and embryos to continue from the disease free parts of the territory of Brazil  the Commission adopted Decision 2008/804/EC (4) excluding the State of São Paulo from the list of territories of Brazil set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC. (4) In the light of the information and guarantees provided by Brazil  and taking into account that at least 6 months have elapsed since the case of glanders was detected and the infected animal destroyed  the State of São Paulo should be reinstated in the list of territories of Brazil in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC in order to allow the importation of equidae and imports of semen  ova and embryos of equine species to resume from this part of the territory of Brazil. The entry for Brazil in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. (5) A veterinary inspection mission carried out in Mauritius recorded shortcomings that require to limit the introduction into the Community of equidae from that country to registered horses complying with the animal health conditions laid down in Annex II(E) to Commission Decision 93/197/EEC of 5 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production (5). Those conditions require amongst others a complete residence period of 3 months and a pre-export isolation in an approved isolation centre protected from vector insects to avoid the introduction of disease into the Community. The entry for Mauritius in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinised starch  no export refund is to be granted.

(4) Following an expiry review of the countervailing measures  the Council  by Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 (9) imposed a countervailing duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India and extended the duty to imports of the same product consigned from Brazil and from Israel  whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not  with the exception of certain producers specified in Article 1(3) of that Regulation. (5) Regulations (EC) No 1292/2007 and (EC) No 367/2006 were last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 15/2009 (10). B.   REQUEST FOR A REVIEW (6) The Commission has received a request for an exemption pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20  23(5) and (6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation from the anti-dumping and countervailing measures extended to imports of PET film consigned from Israel. The application was lodged by S.Z.P. Plastic Packaging Products Ltd (the applicant) a producer in Israel (the country concerned). C.   PRODUCT (7) The product under examination is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consigned from Israel (the product concerned) currently falling within CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90. D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW (8) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the European Union under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 or ex 3920 62 90 during the investigation period used in the investigation that led to the extended measures  i.e. 1 January to 31 December 2003. (9) Furthermore  the applicant alleges that it is not related to exporting producers subject to measures and that it has not circumvented the measures applicable to PET film of Indian origin. E.   PROCEDURE (10) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received. (11) Having examined the evidence available  the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20  23(5) and (6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting the applicant an exemption from the extended measures. (a)   Questionnaires In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation  the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant. (b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore  the Commission may hear interested parties  provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. F.   REPEAL OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS (12) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation  the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the European Union by the applicant. (13) At the same time  such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation  in order to ensure that  should the examination result in a finding of circumvention in respect of the applicant  the anti-dumping duty can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this examination. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding. G.   TIME LIMITS (14) In the interest of sound administration  time limits should be stated within which: (a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission  present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 11(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation; and (b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. H.   NON-COOPERATION (15) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits  or significantly impedes the investigation  findings  affirmative or negative  may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 28 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation  on the basis of the facts available. (16) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information  the information shall be disregarded and use may be made  in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 28 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation  of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially  and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 28 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation  the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA (17) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (11).

3639,20.11.2004 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 344/37 COMMISSION DECISION of 19 November 2004 accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of silicon carbide originating  inter alia  in Ukraine (2004/782/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’)  and in particular Articles 8  21 and 22 (c) thereof  After consulting the Advisory Committee  Whereas: A.   PROCEDURE (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1100/2000 (2)  the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of silicon carbide originating  inter alia  in Ukraine (‘the existing measures’). (2) In March 2004  the Commission announced through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union  (3) the initiation of a partial interim review of the existing measures on imports of the product concerned originating  inter alia  in Ukraine to examine whether they should be amended to take account of certain consequences of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States (‘enlargement’). (3) The Council concluded that it was in the interest of the Community to provide for the temporary adaptation of the existing measures so as to avoid a sudden and excessively negative impact on importers and users in the 10 new Member States acceding to the European Union (‘the EU-10’) immediately following enlargement. It was considered that the best means of achieving this was through the acceptance of an undertaking offered by the co-operating party with an element for a quantitative ceiling. (4) Accordingly  by Decision 2004/498/EC (4)  the Commission accepted as a special measure a short-term undertaking from an exporting producer in Ukraine (Open Joint Stock Company Zaporozhsky Abrasivny Combinat). (5) In order to provide for an exemption from the anti-dumping duties afforded by the acceptance of the undertaking  Regulation (EC) No 1100/2000 was amended by Regulation (EC) No 991/2004. (6) It was stipulated in Decision 2004/498/EC that the acceptance of the undertaking would be limited to an initial period of six months (‘the original period’) without prejudice to the normal duration of the existing measures and that it would lapse after this period unless the Commission considered it appropriate to extend its period of application. (7) Accordingly  the Commission has examined whether the exceptional and negative conditions for interested parties in the EU-10 which led to acceptance of the undertaking still exist. As part of the overall appraisal  an evaluation of the compliance of the company concerned with its undertaking was also made. B.   APPRAISAL 1.   Content of the current undertaking (8) The existing undertaking offered by the company concerned obliges it  inter alia  to export in accordance with its traditional pattern of trade to customers in the EU-10 within the framework of a quantitative ceiling established on the basis of previous  traditional export flows to the EU-10. (9) The terms of the undertaking also oblige the signatory company to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a monthly report of its sales to the EU-10 (or re-sales by any related parties in the Community) and to accept verification visits by the Commission. In order  also  to be able to fully monitor the effectiveness of the undertakings  written agreement was received from the exporter’s traditional customers in the EU-10 that they too would allow on-spot verification visits at their premises. 2.   Compliance with the current undertaking (10) Verification visits to the exporting producer and certain of its traditional customers in the EU-10 confirmed that the company concerned had not exceeded the level of the quantitative ceiling stipulated in the undertaking. In addition  it was found that the company was broadly respecting its traditional pattern of trade with individual customers in the EU-10. Moreover  according to the information available  there have been no apparent ‘spill-overs’ from the EU-10 into the EU-15 of imports of the product concerned which had benefited from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties afforded by the undertaking. 3.   Analysis of conditions for continued acceptance of undertakings (11) Analysis of the monthly reports submitted to the Commission by the company concerned backed up by available official statistical data showed that a marked difference still existed between the prices for the product concerned in the EU-10 and the EU-15. In addition  it was noted that import volumes from Ukraine into the EU-10 had declined since enlargement  however  as indicated in recital (30) of Regulation (EC) No 991/2004  abnormal increases were found in import volumes prior to enlargement in 2003 and the first months of 2004. It is considered that this might have also contributed to the decrease in quantities imported into the EU-10 following enlargement. C.   CONCLUSION 1.   Acceptance of an undertaking (12) Given that the exceptional and negative conditions which prevailed prior to enlargement and which necessitated the undertaking still exist  and that the terms of the undertaking have been observed during the initial period of its application by the company concerned  it is considered that the acceptance of an undertaking offered by the company concerned for a further period is justified. (13) As concerns the length of this further period  it is considered that a period of application of more than six months would negate the notion of the undertaking being of a transitional nature  therefore  acceptance will only be from 21 November 2004 to 20 May 2005 (‘the final period’). (14) With regard to the level of the quantitative ceiling to be applied for the final period  this has been calculated following the same methodology as was used to establish the quantitative ceiling for the original period. (15) In conformity with Regulation (EC) No 991/2004  the undertaking obliges the exporting producer to respect the import ceilings and in order that the undertakings can be monitored  the exporting producer concerned has also agreed to broadly respect its traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU-10. The exporting producer is also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly  or that the undertaking become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor  the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place  or it may adjust the level of the ceiling  or it may take other remedial action. (16) It is also a condition of the undertaking that if it is breached in any way  the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place. (17) The company will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning its exports to the Community  meaning that the undertaking can be monitored effectively by the Commission. (18) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the company’s compliance with the undertakings  when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority  exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 991/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented  or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs  the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable. 2.   Disclosure to interested parties (19) All interested parties which had previously made themselves known were advised of the intention to accept an undertaking. The Community Industry raised certain concerns that a possible ‘spill-over’ of Ukrainian silicon carbide into the EU-15 had occurred  however  during a verification visit by the Commission  it was established that the silicon carbide in question was not of Ukrainian origin. The Community Industry nevertheless expressed the view that an undertaking should not be accepted. (20) Whilst the position of the Community Industry regarding the acceptance of an undertaking is noted  the circumstances and needs of importers and users in the EU-10 must also be taken into account. On balance  in view of the importance of continued supply for customers in the EU-10  it is considered that this outweighs the concerns of the Community Industry. (21) No other comments or submissions were made which caused the Commission to alter its views on the matter ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3643,8.4.2011 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 94/29 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION of 6 April 2011 on the temporary prohibition of the placing on the market in Germany of the detergent POR-ÇÖZ (notified under document C(2011) 2290) (2011/225/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on detergents (1)  and in particular Article 15 and 12(2) thereof  Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (2)  and in particular Article 5 thereof  Whereas: (1) On 29 October 2010  the German Federal Environment Agency notified the Commission and the other Member States of their temporary prohibition for the placing on the German market of the cleaning product POR-ÇÖZ with a nitric acid content of 20 % or more  based on risks of corrosion and dangerous fumes resulting from the ingredient nitric acid (3). (2) The German authorities additionally notified the temporary prohibition of POR-ÇÖZ to the Commission via RAPEX (4) under Article 12 of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (5). As an additional risk it was mentioned that the POR-ÇÖZ containers did not have sufficiently child-proof caps. (3) POR-ÇÖZ is manufactured in Turkey by the registered company Levent Kimya and imported into Germany by the company Karakus Handels GmbH with its registered seat in D-58638 Iserlohn. (4) POR-ÇÖZ contains 20-30 % nitric acid in aqueous solution. Nitric acid is classified as corrosive to the skin  category 1  under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) concerning classification  labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures. (5) POR-ÇÖZ is marketed as a limescale and rust remover to the general public. It is a mixture intended for cleaning purposes and is therefore a detergent according to Article 2 of the Regulation. (6) Based on the presentation of facts in the German RAPEX notification  the product POR-ÇÖZ is not fitted with appropriate child-resistant fastenings. Consequently  it does not comply with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 in combination with Article 9  paragraph 1.3 and Annex IV  Part A of Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) relating to the classification  packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations and does not fall under Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 which is applicable only to products that are ‘complying with the requirement of this Regulation’. (7) A clarification of the facts was made orally by Germany at the meeting of the Detergents Working Group on 14 December 2010. Germany explained that there had been two products under the brand name POR-ÇÖZ on the German market. The product referred to in the notification to the Commission of 29 October 2010  which was imported by Karakus Handels GmbH  was correctly labelled and fitted with appropriate child-resistant fastening. The second POR-ÇÖZ product by the same manufacturer was imported illegally via unknown channels. It was labelled in Turkish language and was not fitted with sufficiently child-proof fastenings. (8) By letter of 22 December 2010  Germany confirmed that the product to which Germany had referred in its notification of 29 October 2010 (manufactured by Levent Kimya and imported into Germany by the company Karakus Handels GmbH) was complying with the Detergents Regulation  notably with its labelling and packaging requirements by having a German-language label and by being fitted with child-proof fastening. The RAPEX Notification No 1760/10 has been modified with a revised notification submitted to the Commission on 16 December 2010  which stated that the grounds for prohibition were not non-compliance with legal requirements but the product’s high risks for human health. (9) Based on these facts  Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 is applicable  as the product POR-ÇÖZ referred to in the German notification is a detergent complying with the requirements of that Regulation. (10) Germany has provided justifiable grounds for believing that the product POR-ÇÖZ constitutes a risk to safety or health of humans. Germany reported that one case of child injury is attributed to the use of POR-ÇÖZ in Germany. Furthermore  between 1999 and 2010  German poison centres registered 134 cases of severe injuries to health related to the use in households of lime and rust removers containing nitric acid. In Belgium (the only other Member State where a Turkish-labelled version of POR-ÇÖZ had been found on the market) anti-poison centres have recorded three cases of severe respiratory problems resulting from the professional use of limescale removers containing 30 % nitric acid. Based on an assessment of the risks to health from the use of cleaning products with a nitric acid content of 20-30 %  on 28 September 2010  the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment recommended that cleaning products containing more than 20 % nitric acid should not be placed on the market for supply to the general public (8). (11) The Commission has consulted the Member States both via questionnaires sent out on 15 November 2010 and in a meeting of the Detergents Working Group Meeting on 14 December 2010.

3644,COMMISSION  DECISION of 4 April 1995 on German aid to the coal industry for 1995 (Only the German text is  authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (95/464/ECSC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community  Having regard to Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community  rules for State aid to the coal industry  (1)  and in particular Articles 2 (1) and 9 thereof  Whereas: I By letter of 25 January 1995  Germany notified the Commission  in accordance with Article 9 (1)  of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC  of the aid it intended to grant to the coal industry in 1995. In accordance with that Decision  the Commission establishes the following measures for 1995: -  aid totalling DM 95 million for maintaining the underground labour force ('Bergmannspraemie`)  -  aid totalling DM 5  900 million under the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law of 13 December 1974   (2) ('drittes Verstromungsgesetz`) in the form of revenue from the compensation fund  ('Ausgleichsfonds`) for 1995. This corresponds to a levy rate ('Kohlepfennig`) of 8 5  %  -  aid totalling DM 200 million to cover exceptional costs for the undertakings Ruhrkohle AG   Saarbergwerke AG  Gewerkschaft Auguste Victoria  Sophia Jacoba GmbH and Preussag. The financial measures proposed by the Federal Government for the coal industry comply with the  provisions of Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and are to be approved by the Commission in  accordance with Article 9. The Commission is to take its decision above all with regard to the  general objectives and criteria defined in Article 2 and the specific criteria defined in Articles  3 and 4 of the Decision. In accordance with Article 9 (6) of the Decision  the Commission is  required to check whether the measures are in conformity with the modernization  rationalization  and restructuring plans on which it expressed a favourable opinion on 13 December 1994 in  accordance with Article 8 (2) and (3). II The aid of DM 92 8 million for compensation between coalfields and the aid of DM 50 8 million  for compensation for coal with a low volatile-matter content are intended to provide partial  compensation for the fact that some coal producers receive revenue which is lower than production  costs because of sales to electricity producers. According to the information provided by the  Federal Government  the compensation between coalfields relates to 7 4 million tonnes and the  compensation for coal with a low volatile-matter content to 2 3 million tonnes. Since 1990 this  amount has been reduced by 10  % per annum. The inclusion of this aid in the modernization  restructuring and rationalization plan and its  gradual reduction will contribute to greater financial discipline in the undertakings concerned.  This aid therefore achieves the objectives set out in the first indent of Article 2 (1) of the  Decision i.e. to make  in the light of coal prices on international markets  further progress  towards economic viability and consequently to reduce aid. In assessing this aid  the Commission has  in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1)   also taken account of the urgent need to ease the social and regional impact of restructuring. In accordance with Article 3 of the Decision  the aid helps to improve the economic viability of  the undertakings concerned by reducing production costs. The slight reduction in costs expected in 1995 at constant prices compared with 1994 should  generate a trend towards a reduction in production costs within the meaning of the second indent of  Article 3 (2). In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by the Federal Government   the aid planned for 1995 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the  smooth functioning of the internal market. III Aid totalling DM 95 million to finance the 'Bergmannspraemie` is planned to enable mining  undertakings to maintain their underground labour force in deep mines. This aid corresponds to DM  10 per underground shift. According to the information provided by Germany  this aid is an extra  payment to miners and also reduces production costs. It is therefore aid which has to be assessed  by reference to Article 3 of the Decision. The aid contributes to increasing productivity and therefore helps in the restructuring and  rationalization of the coal industry. It therefore also helps to achieve the objectives referred to  in the first indent of Article 2 (1)  i.e. to make  in the light of coal prices on international  markets  further progress towards economic viability and consequently to reduce aid. In assessing this aid  the Commission has  in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1)   also taken account of the urgent need to ease the social and regional impact of restructuring. The slight reduction in costs at constant prices expected in 1995 compared with 1994 should  generate a trend towards a reduction in production costs within the meaning of the second indent of  Article 3 (2). This aid will improve the economic viability of the undertakings concerned in accordance with the  provisions of Article 3 of the Decision by reducing production costs. In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by the Federal Government   the aid planned for 1995 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the  smooth functioning of the internal market. IV The aid of DM 5  900 million to the coal industry planned by the Federal Government is covered  by the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law which provides for the creation of a compensation fund  financed from a levy  the 'Kohlepfennig`. The purpose of this fund is to provide partial  compensation for price differences between Community coal and imported coal in respect of 11 5  million tce and between Community coal and fuel oil in respect of 23 million tce. The compensation  fund therefore covers 34 5 million tce per annum and benefits electricity producers who purchase  German coal at a price which more or less reflects production costs. This measure constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 1 (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC   according to which the term 'aid` also covers the allocation  for the direct or indirect benefit of  the coal industry  of the charges rendered compulsory as a result of State intervention  without  any distinction being drawn between aid granted by the State and aid granted by public or private  bodies appointed by the State to administer such aid. The Commission must therefore take a decision  on this measure in accordance with Article 9 of the Decision. A decision has been taken each year pursuant to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC  (1) on aid  granted in accordance with the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law. In accordance with Article 9 (7) of  Decision No 3632/93/ECSC  the existing rules must be brought into line with the provisions of this  Decision no later than 31 December 1996. If this has not been done  an assessment must be made as  to whether the aid corresponds to the principles set out in Article 2 (1) of the Decision. In this  context it should be pointed out that  by decision of 11 October 1994 (ref. 2 BvR 633/86)  the  Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the provisions of the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law  concerning the imposition of the 'Kohlepfennig` levy for the benefit of the German coal industry  are incompatible with the basic law 'Grundgesetz`) and that they must cease to be applied with  effect from 1 January 1996. The slight increase of 1 7  % in the aid in 1995 compared with 1994 is due to the slight nominal  increase in production costs at current prices (which  however  corresponds to a decrease at  constant prices) and the estimated downward trend in energy prices in German marks of 10  %  which  is itself a result of trends on the world market for coal and heavy fuel oil and changes in the  exchange rate of the German mark to the United States Dollar. The Federal Government has therefore  decided to place an upper limit at current prices on this aid as from 1 January 1996 and gradually  to further reduce it as from 1 January 1997. In view of the proposed increase in the aid for 1995 of 1 7  % compared with 1994  the Commission  welcomes the Federal Government's decision to introduce a ceiling in 1996 and gradually to further  reduce it within the meaning of the first indent of Article 2 (1). In assessing this aid  the Commission has  in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1)   also taken account of the urgent need to ease the social and regional impact of restructuring. In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by the Federal Government   the aid planned for 1995 is compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2 of Decision No  3632/93/ECSC and with the smooth functioning of the internal market. V The aid amounting to DM 200 million to cover exceptional costs in favour of the undertakings  Ruhrkohle AG  Saarbergwerke AG  Gewerkschaft Auguste Victoria  Sophia Jacoba GmbH and Preussag is  intended to cover additional costs arising in conjunction with the removal of waste water from pits  which were closed down as part of the restructuring measures and are near working pits. Since  little or no water is drained from the closed pits  some of the water which is not in any way used  in connection with production flows into nearby working pits  thereby creating additional costs. This aid is expressly referred to in point II (b) of the Annex to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC as a  measure intended to cover expenditure  resulting from restructuring  on the supply of water and the  removal of waste water. In order to comply with the provisions of Article 5 of that Decision  it  may not exceed those costs. The Commission has examined the information provided by Germany and the agreements between the  State and the undertakings concerned and has come to the conclusions that this condition has been  met. This assistance will reduce the financial imbalance within the companies concerned and enable them  to continue to operate. The aid therefore complies with the objectives set out in Article 2 (1) of  Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. VI This Decision does not prejudge the question of whether the new German system of aid which  must be introduced for coal intended for the steel industry is compatible with the Treaties and  with Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. This also applies to the changes which have to be made  in  accordance with Article 9 (7)  to the rules on aid which are linked to agreements between coal and  electricity producers. The Federal Government must ensure that the aid granted pursuant to this Decision does not exceed   for each undertaking or production unit  the difference between production costs and foreseeable  revenue. The Commission is required  pursuant to the second indent of Article 3 (1) and Article 9 (2) and  (3) of Decision No 3623/93/ECSC  to verify whether the aid granted for current production achieves  the objectives set out in Articles 3 and 4 of that Decision. It must therefore be informed as to  the level of payments and their allocation ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Whereas: (1) The animal health conditions and veterinary certification for the importation of fresh meat from certain European countries were established by Commission Decision 98/371/EC(3)  as last amended by Decision 2000/19/EC(4). (2) Imports of fresh meat must take into account the different epidemiological situations in the country concerned. (3) Following a recent Commission veterinary mission to Lithuania  it appears that the animal health situation is satisfactory in the whole country and that a residue plan has been agreed. (4) The competent veterinary authorities of Lithuania have confirmed that it has been free from rinderpest  and foot-and-mouth disease for at least 12 months. Furthermore they have undertaken to notify the Commission and the Member States within 24 hours  by fax  telex or telegram of the confirmation of the occurrence of any of those diseases or of any alteration in the vaccination policy against them.

(2) The complaint was lodged by the European Industrial Fasteners Institute (EIFI) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion  in this case more than 25 %  of the total Union production of certain stainless steel fasteners pursuant to Articles 9(1) and 10(6) of the basic Regulation. (3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of subsidisation and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding. (4) Prior to the initiation of the proceeding and in accordance with Article 10(7) of the basic Regulation  the Commission notified the governments of the countries concerned that it had received a properly documented complaint alleging that subsidised imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries were causing material injury to the Union industry. The governments of the countries concerned were separately invited for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as regards the content of the complaint and arriving at a mutually agreed solution. During the consultations no mutually agreed solution was found. (5) The Commission  after consultation of the Advisory Committee  by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union  (2)  accordingly initiated an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned  currently falling within CN codes 7318 12 10  7318 14 10  7318 15 30  7318 15 51  7318 15 61 and 7318 15 70. (6) On the same day  the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned (3). (7) The Commission sent questionnaires to the Union industry and to any known association of producers in the Union  to the exporters/producers in the countries concerned  to any association of exporters/producers  to the importers  to any known association of importers  and to the authorities of the countries concerned. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (8) By its letter of 1 April 2010 to the Commission  EIFI formally withdrew its complaint. (9) In accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation  the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn  unless such termination would not be in the Union interest. (10) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest. (11) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned should be terminated ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States  the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time. (2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2007 (1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007). On the basis of the data published by the United States’ Customs and Border Protection  the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 33 38 million.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000  the rate of the refund per 100 kg for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month. (4) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (5) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account should be taken  where necessary  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.

(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999  provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14  15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund  in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods’ arrival at destination. (3) In the case of a differentiated refund  Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund  calculated using the lowest refund rate  is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community. (4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 of 24 September 2004 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Bulgaria and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Bulgaria (4)  provides on an autonomous basis for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Bulgaria  from 1 October 2004. (5) Bulgaria has undertaken to grant the preferential import arrangements to goods imported into its territory only if the goods concerned are accompanied by documents stating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds. (6) In the light of those arrangements  as a transitory measure in view of the possible accession to the European Union of Bulgaria and in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries  it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate  where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question  not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined. (7) Since the autonomous and transitional measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 will apply as from 1 October 2004 this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.

(2) In its response of 10 April 2014 to the letter of 19 February 2014 of the Commission regarding the simplification of VAT own resources inspections (3)  Portugal requested authorisation from the Commission to use a fixed percentage of the intermediate base for the calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point 10 of Annex X  Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC for the financial years 2014 to 2020. Portugal has shown that the historical percentage has remained stable over time. Portugal should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT own resources base using a fixed percentage in accordance with the letter sent by the Commission. (3) Portugal has requested authorisation from the Commission to use ESA 2010 National Accounts data from 2011 to calculate the weighted average rate of VAT for the financial year 2014. The latest available ESA 95 National Accounts data with the necessary level of disaggregation is from year 2010  whereas ESA 2010 National Accounts data with the necessary disaggregation will be available from year 2011 by the time Portugal has to submit its statement of the VAT own resources base for the financial year 2014. Portugal should therefore be authorised to use ESA 2010 National Accounts data from year 2011 for the purpose of calculating the weighted average rate of VAT for financial year 2014. (4) Under Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) (ESA 2010)  Member States may  for the purpose of determination of the VAT-based own resource  use data based on the ESA 2010 while Council Decision 2007/436/EC  Euratom (5) remains in force  where the required detailed ESA 95 data are not available.

(2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports  in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However  the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets. (3) For certain EU producers of sugar and isoglucose  exports from the Union represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Union. Exports of sugar and isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose exports so that the EU producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets. (4) For the 2010/2011 marketing year it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit initially at 650 000 tonnes  in white sugar equivalent  for out-of-quota sugar exports and 50 000 tonnes  in dry matter  for out-of-quota isoglucose would correspond to the market demand. (5) Exports of sugar from the Union to certain close destinations and to third countries granting EU products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favorable competitive position. In view of the absence of appropriate instruments of mutual assistance to fight against irregularities and in order to minimize the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or reintroduction into the Union of out-of-quota sugar certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations. (6) In view of the estimated lower risks for eventual frauds regarding isoglucose due to the nature of the product it is not necessary to restrict the eligible destinations for the export of out-of-quota isoglucose.

Articles 14  15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the refund when a differentiated refund applies and in particular the documents to be presented to prove the arrival of the product at destination. (2) When a differentiated refund applies  Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 stipulates that part of the refund  calculated using the lowest refund rate  is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community. (3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 602/2001(6)  provides for exceptions to Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 as a result of a trade agreement concluded in 2000 on the abolition of refunds on common wheat  flour and bran exported to Poland. (4) Trade agreements have recently been concluded between the European Community and Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania (the Baltic States) establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and the total liberalisation of trade in other agricultural products. In the cereals sector  one of these concessions is the abolition of refunds on most of the products referred to in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92.

(6) Account must therefore be taken of those special arrangements  which are due to enter into force on 1 July 2002  so as not to impose unnecessary costs on exporters trading with the third countries concerned. To that end  in determining the lowest rate of refund  no account should be taken of the fact that no refund has been fixed for the destination concerned. (7) The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 containing the exceptions to Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 should therefore be adapted to take account of the new trade agreements concluded with the Baltic States.

In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified. (2) Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (5) provides that no refund is to be granted where the products are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the date on which the export declaration is accepted. (3) Such requirements have nevertheless proved insufficient to ensure that uniform conditions apply when refunds are paid on some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(q) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. (4) Additional conditions relating to products of average quality and enabling the payment of refunds on products of inferior quality to be refused should consequently be laid down at Community level. (5) Provision should be made for an additional quality in the case of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 99 and 1602 49 19  not containing poultrymeat and for which the quality criteria should be set high in order to limit any refunds granted to such products where the quantities covered by export licence applications exceed or are likely to exceed traditional quantities. (6) It is essential to make provision for checks to ensure compliance with this Regulation. Such checks are to be conducted pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2090/2002 of 26 November 2002 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 as regards physical checks carried out when agricultural products qualifying for refunds are exported (6)  and must in particular include an organoleptic examination and physical and chemical analyses.

PROCEDURE (1) Definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties were imposed on farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway by Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(3) and (EC) No 1891/97(4). The form of the duties set out in these two Regulations was  however  later reviewed  with both Regulations being replaced by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(5). (2) At the same time as definitive duties were imposed  individual price undertakings were also accepted from 190 Norwegian exporters by Commission Decision 97/634/EC(6). By offering undertakings  the companies all agreed to respect certain minimum import prices for their sales of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and to provide the Commission  within due deadlines  periodic reports of their sales to the Community. (3) However  due to the late receipt by the Commission of one such sales report from the Norwegian exporter Gje-Vi AS  a breach of the terms of the company's undertaking was deemed to have occurred. Acceptance of this company's undertaking was withdrawn by the Commission by Regulation (EC) No 651/98(7)  with definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed in its place by Council Regulation (EC) No 772/98(8). B. REQUEST FOR A REVIEW (4) Gje-Vi AS (hereafter referred to as the ""Applicant"")  subsequently made a satisfactory request for a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 and Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97. (5) The request contained sufficient evidence of a significant change in circumstances which had occurred since the imposition of duties against its exports to the Community. The company therefore wished to offer again a price undertaking and submitted that  in view of these changes  such an undertaking would be both effective and practicable. (6) A Notice of initiation of a partial interim review was published accordingly(9). It should be noted in this regard that the review was limited in scope to an examination of whether a new undertaking can be accepted from the Applicant. C. REVIEW INVESTIGATION 1.1. Product concerned (7) The product concerned is farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway currently classifiable within CN codes ex 0302 12 00 (TARIC codes 0302 12 00*21  0302 12 00*22  0302 12 00*23 and 0302 12 00*29 )  ex 0303 22 00 (TARIC codes 0303 22 00*21  0302 22 00*22  0303 22 00*23 and 0302 22 00*29 )  ex 0304 10 13 (TARIC codes 0304 10 13*21 and 0304 10 13*29 ) and ex 0304 20 13 (TARIC codes 0304 20 13*21 and 0304 20 13*29 ). 1.2. Parties concerned by the investigation (8) The Applicant  the representative associations of producers in Norway and the Community  importers in the Community and the authorities in Norway were officially advised of the initiation of the review. All the parties directly concerned were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. (9) The Applicant was sent a questionnaire and submitted a reply within the time limits specified. A verification visit was subsequently carried out at its premises in Norway. D. FINDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION (10) The investigation showed that the Applicant has a different management structure and is now better organised than it was in 1998 when poor internal coordination and lack of personnel who were able to deal with the obligations imposed by the undertaking were the reason for the breach. (11) The company's accounting staff are aware of the type and level of information that would be required for the quarterly sales reports as well as the need to submit the reports in due time  and there are no reasons for supposing that the same error would occur again. (12) Furthermore  the company now has a good computerised accounting system which can accommodate the software necessary for the quarterly sales reports to the Commission. (13) Importantly  also  the personnel who are now involved in selling the product concerned to the Community are aware that a strict system of minimum import prices applies and also know the price levels below which farmed Atlantic salmon cannot be sold. There are no indications or grounds for believing that the company would not observe the terms of the undertaking vis-Ă -vis the applicable minimum import prices. (14) In view of the foregoing and the changed circumstances which have occurred since the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties against the company  the offer of an undertaking from Gje-Vi AS is considered acceptable. (15) In this regard  the undertaking has been formally accepted by Commission Decision 2002/157/EC(10). E. CORRIGENDUM TO REGULATION (EC) No 1677/2001 (16) During publication of Regulation (EC) No 1677/2001(11)  the name of the Norwegian company  Janas A/S (UT No 1/75  TARIC Additional Code 8177 ) was inadvertently omitted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted and thus exempted from the definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties. (17) Accordingly  the name of this company should be inserted into the aforementioned list. F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION (EC) No 772/1999 (18) In view of all the above  the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 should be amended accordingly ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3736,Commission Regulation (EC) No 694/2004 of 15 April 2004 fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1)  and in particular Article 31(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation  exported in the natural state  are being fixed  account must be taken of: - the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade  - marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community  as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination  - the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market  - the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty  and - the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market  and - the economic aspect of the proposed exports. (3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation  and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of: (a) prices ruling on third-country markets; (b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third-country imports; (c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries  account being taken  where appropriate  of subsidies granted by those countries; and (d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices. (4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination. (5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may  however  remain at the same level for more than four weeks. (6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(2)  the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(3)  however  this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community. (7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(4) laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products. (8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account. (9) With a view to enlargement on 1 May 2004 and to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the new Member States on the Community level  all remaining refunds for exports to the new Member States should be abolished. (10) The consolidation of the maximum quantities for export within the limits set in the WTO Agreement will be more binding on the accession of the new Member States. In order to ensure the satisfactory management and optimum use of the maximum quantities for export  steps should therefore be taken to reduce or abolish the refunds for certain destinations  in particular those located in or close to the geographical area of the Community where the level of prices for milk products no longer justify the present level of refund rates  despite the collection of import duty in some of those countries. (11) The policy of some non-member countries is to prevent disturbance on the internal market by applying frontier measures. The refunds for certain milk products exported to those destinations should be differentiated in order to reduce the risk of such measures being applied. (12) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

In fixing this maximum  the criteria provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 must be taken into account.

3749,COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 527/96 of 25 March 1996 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties and progressively introducing the Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the Canary Islands THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  and in particular Article 28 thereof  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  Whereas Article 6 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 of 26 June 1991 on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands (1) provides for the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) to be progressively introduced in the course of a transitional period which shall not extend beyond 31 December 2000; whereas  in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation  the common commercial policy shall apply to the Canary Islands  without prejudice to the specific measures referred to in Article 6 (3) thereof; Whereas paragraph 7.2 of the Annex to Council Decision 91/314/EEC of 26 June 1991 setting up a programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the Canary Islands (Poseican) (2) states that specific tariff measures must continue to be considered and that in principle they must be limited to the transitional period provided for under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 for the gradual adoption of the CCT to the Canary Islands; Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 of 15 June 1992 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the Canary Islands (3) suspended in full until 31 December 1995 CCT duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of the products listed in the Annex to the Regulation which are intended for the Canary Islands' domestic market; Whereas  in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1605/95  the Commission has examined this year the effect of measures adopted in favour of the economy of the Canary Islands; whereas that examination has shown that the suspension of duties on certain industrial products has not had the effect of increasing the volume of imports originating in non-Community countries; Whereas the progressive introduction of the suspended CCT duties will not in principle have any adverse effect on the sectors concerned by the duty suspensions or  in general  on the Canary Islands' economy as a whole; whereas an appropriate timetable should be laid down for successive increases in the applicable rates of duty; Whereas  in order to take advantage of the closing date of the transitional period laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 and to take account of the request from the Spanish authorities  the duty suspensions under Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 may be retained in 1996; Whereas  in view of the foregoing  the progressive introduction of CCT duties must commence on 1 January 1997 until fully applicable on 31 December 2000; whereas  in the case of certain sensitive sectors of the Canary Islands' economy  in particular those processing imported raw materials into finished products and commerce  duties should be introduced in a flexible manner so as to prevent in the early years any adverse effect on production and employment in those sectors; Whereas the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994  approved by the Community by Decision 94/800/EC (4) provides for bound tariff reductions to be implemented in five equal rate reductions (or 10 rate reductions for certain tariff headings); whereas that progressive reduction  which became operative in 1995  will culminate in a minimum  or even a zero  rate by the end of the period in question; whereas  consequently  duty suspensions should continue in respect of certain industrial products on which CCT duties resulting from the GATT agreements would reach a zero or minimum rate on 31 December 2000  the date on which the transitional period for the Canary Islands expires; Whereas imports into the Canary Islands of certain goods originating in non-Community countries were non-existent or nearly so during the period in which CCT duty suspensions applied; whereas  consequently  there are no grounds for retaining those suspensions; Whereas the measures taken under Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 should be retained  on the one hand  in order to ensure that products on which the suspension of duty is extended and then progressively dismantled are intended solely for the Canary Islands' domestic market and  on the other hand  in order to permit the Commission to be regularly informed of the volume of the imports in question and  if necessary  to adopt provisions designed to prevent any speculative movement of deflection of trade ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals  rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals  rice  broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and  furthermore  to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports  and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market. (3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6)  on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated. (4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash  crude fibre  tegument  protein  fat and starch content of the individual product concerned  this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product. (5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc  other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom  given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals  the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time. (6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination. (7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. (8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products  containing pregelatinized starch  no export refund is to be granted.

However  where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined  account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market  adjusted  where appropriate  to take account of export costs for the products on the world market. (5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent  point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC  it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals (2). (3) As far as wheat and rye flour  groats and meal are concerned  when the refund on these products is being calculated  account must be taken of the quantities of cereals required for their manufacture.

(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2)  provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content  including  where appropriate  other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3)  to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation. (4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account  on the one hand  of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and  on the other  of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements. (5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001  the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation. (6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter  taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g)  the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h)  the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95. (7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.

(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. (10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds  refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. (11) In view of the above  refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification  the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ‘cereal products’  namely for maize  the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products  and for ‘other cereals’  these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff. (4) Furthermore  the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market  the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.

(2) In order to take into account the potential impact of the accession of the Czech Republic  Estonia  Cyprus  Latvia  Lithuania  Hungary  Malta  Poland  Slovenia and Slovakia to the Community on 1 May 2004  on the Community milk market and the need to monitor developments in the Community and world markets  Commission Regulation (EC) No 606/2004 (3) provided for that  by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 174/1999  the term of validity of export licences for milk products for which an application has been lodged from 15 April 2004 on should be limited to 30 June 2004. (3) A close monitoring of both the internal and the world market since 1 May 2004 has shown that a longer validity period of the licences may be reestablished without any risk of destabilisation of the proper functioning of the common market organisation. It is therefore appropriate to repeal Regulation (EC) No 606/2004. (4) In light of a proper management of the GATT export commitments it is appropriate to adapt the export licence validity period for the groups of products concerned; taking account of the quantities remaining in the respective export quotas at the end of the GATT year and with a view on an optimal use of the available quantities.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar  undenatured and exported in its unaltered state  are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. (3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality.

(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial. (8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund  no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation. (9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar  and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market  refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

3902,COMMISSION  DECISION of 14 July 1989 authorizing methods for grading pig carcases in Germany (Only the German text is authentic) (89/471/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1)  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2)  and in particular Article 4 (6) thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 of 13 November 1984 determining the Community scale for grading pig carcases (3)  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3530/86 (4)  and in particular Article 5 (2) thereof  Whereas Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 provides that the grading of pig carcases must be determined by estimating the content of lean meat in accordance with statistically proven assessment methods based on the physical measurement of one or more anatomical parts of the pig carcase; whereas the authorization of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment; whereas this tolerance has been defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases (5); Whereas the Commission  by its Decision 87/43/EEC (6)  has authorized methods for grading pig carcases in Germany; Whereas their application has shown that the results of the three authorized methods are difficult to compare; Whereas with a view to improving the transparency of the market  the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has requested the Commission to authorize the use of one main method on its territory consisting in the fixing of measuring points and of a single estimation formula for the lean meat content and has submitted for this purpose the information required in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85; whereas an examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorizing the said grading methods are fulfilled; Whereas  however  the method to be thus authorized concerning the taking of measurements is based on the use of the apparatus 'Ultrasound-Scanner' ('SSD 256') the use of which in the abattoirs in general does not seem to be possible in practice; whereas as a consequence it is appropriate  subject to supervision by the Commission  to authorize the use of other apparatus for the grading of pig carcases after they have passed a calibration test by giving equivalent results concerning the values of assessment measurements of the percentage of lean meat to those obtained by the use of the 'Ultrasound-Scanner' ('SSD 256'); Whereas it is necessary  in addition  to maintain a simple method for small abattoirs which are not in a position to bear investment costs engendered by the method mentioned above; whereas for this reason it is appropriate for the moment to continue the use of the method known as 'Zwei-Punkt-Messverfahren' but to limit its use to abattoirs which do not exceed a fixed amount of slaughterings; Whereas a new decision should be adopted for the sake of clarity to include the two methods mentioned above; whereas  as a consequence  Decision 87/43/EEC should be repealed; Whereas no modification of apparatus or grading method may be authorized except by means of a new Commission decision adopted in the light of experience gained; whereas  for this reason  the present authorization may be revoked; Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2) On 9 February 2005 the competent food assessment body of Germany issued its initial assessment report. In that report it came to the conclusion that the extension of uses of the oil from the micro-algae Ulkenia sp. might bear the risk that intakes of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) would increase in an unacceptable manner. (3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 21 April 2005. (4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision. (5) In their objections Member States raised concerns about elevated intake levels of omega-3 fatty acids and in particular DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). (6) However  the main source of omega-3 fatty acids is fish-oil. Today  in the foods of the categories for which the addition of oil from the micro-algae Ulkenia sp. was requested omega-3 fatty acids can be provided either from fish oil or alternatively from the micro algae Ulkenia sp. (7) Therefore it is not expected that the use of oil from micro-algae in the food groups mentioned in the Annex will lead to an unacceptable additional increase of the overall intake of omega-3 fatty acids. (8) The oil from the micro-algae Ulkenia sp. complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 258/97.

(2) Chapter II of Annex D to Directive 64/432/EEC provides that tests for EBL are to be carried out by either agar gel immune-diffusion test (AGID) with the use of antigen standardised against the official EC standard serum (EI serum)  or by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) standardised against E4 serum. Both standard sera are supplied by the National Veterinary Institute  Technical University of Denmark. (3) A new EBL standard serum (E05 serum) has recently been developed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference Laboratory for Enzootic Bovine Leukosis in Germany (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute) in cooperation with the OIE Reference Laboratories in the United Kingdom (Veterinary Laboratories Agency) and in Poland (National Veterinary Research Institute) after being tested in a ring trial between those laboratories. The E05 serum has been validated against the EI and E4 sera by different AGID and ELISAs and consequently included as an accredited OIE standard serum in Section B(2) of Chapter 2.4.11 of the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals  Sixth Edition  2008. This serum is available from the OIE Reference Laboratory for enzootic bovine leukosis in Germany. (4) In addition  the National Veterinary Institute  Technical University of Denmark has informed the Commission that it is no longer able to fulfil its obligations for the supply of the standard sera currently provided for in Chapter II of Annex D to Directive 64/432/EEC. (5) The German competent authorities and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute have agreed to be a supplier of the E05 serum which shall consequently become the new official European Union (EU) standard serum for EBL.

(2) The list of approved fish farms in Germany was established by Commission Decision 95/124/EC(3)  as last amended by Decision 2000/173/EC(4). (3) Germany  by letters of 17 September 1999 and 21 December 1999  has submitted to the Commission the justifications for obtaining the status of approved farm in a non-approved zone in respect of IHN and VHS for certain fish farms situated in Lower Saxony  Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg  as well as the national rules ensuring compliance with the requirements for maintenance of the approved status. (4) The Commission and the Member States examined the justifications notified by Germany for each farm. (5) The result of this examination is that certain of the farms concerned meet the requirements of Article 6 of Council Directive 91/67/EEC. (6) Therefore  the farms in question are eligible for the status of approved farm situated in a non-approved zone.
